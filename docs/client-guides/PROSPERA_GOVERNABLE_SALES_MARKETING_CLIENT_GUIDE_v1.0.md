What Problem This Solves

Modern sales and marketing teams increasingly rely on AI to generate content,
target audiences, and automate communication.

However, most organizations face the same risks:

AI-generated content published without accountability

Regulatory or brand violations discovered after release

No clear ownership when issues occur

Difficulty proving compliance during audits

Prospera addresses these risks by ensuring that every externally facing action
remains governed, auditable, and human-authorized.

How Prospera Works (In Plain Terms)

Prospera does not replace your marketing team.
It governs how decisions are made before actions are executed.

All sales and marketing activities follow a mandatory decision sequence that ensures:

Clear business intent

Valid operating context

Policy and regulatory compliance

Risk awareness

Explicit human authorization

Controlled execution

Full traceability and recovery

AI assists with work generation, but never makes final decisions.

What AI Is Allowed (and Not Allowed) To Do

AI can:

Draft marketing content

Suggest audience segments

Propose campaign options

AI cannot:

Decide what gets published

Approve content or campaigns

Override policies or authority

Act without human accountability
