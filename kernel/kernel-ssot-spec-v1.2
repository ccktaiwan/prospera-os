Status: Stable
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: Kernel Specification

Purpose
The SSOT (Single Source of Truth) Specification defines how truth, identity, state, and lineage are stored, validated, and propagated across Prospera OS.
The SSOT rules in this document are mandatory for all layers, systems, engines, modules, and contracts.
Any violation of SSOT lineage is considered a critical system failure.

SSOT Core Principles
2.1 SSOT is the canonical truth source for all system state.
2.2 All components must reference SSOT and cannot maintain their own truth stores.
2.3 SSOT lineage must remain complete, traceable, deterministic, and tamper-proof.
2.4 SSOT cannot be duplicated, shadowed, or partially implemented.
2.5 SSOT is owned by the Kernel and cannot depend on lower layers.

SSOT Lineage Rules
3.1 Each component must declare its SSOT lineage path.
3.2 All lineage must originate from Kernel-level structures.
3.3 System components must maintain pure lineage without introducing state.
3.4 Engines may read SSOT but cannot create, mutate, or fork lineage.
3.5 Modules must only operate on SSOT-consistent platform signals.

State Truth Rules
4.1 SSOT contains the only valid state representation in Prospera OS.
4.2 State must not be stored in engines, modules, or pipelines.
4.3 No component may cache or rewrite state outside SSOT.
4.4 Inconsistencies must trigger Governance remediation.
4.5 Truth conflicts must always resolve in favor of Kernel SSOT.

SSOT Access Rules
5.1 Systems may read SSOT but cannot modify it.
5.2 Engines may perform read-only operations based on approved contracts.
5.3 Modules may not access SSOT directly; they operate via validated signals.
5.4 Contracts may define limited SSOT access but cannot override Kernel rules.
5.5 Unauthorized SSOT access is a critical violation.

SSOT Mutation Rules
6.1 Only Kernel-controlled processes may mutate SSOT.
6.2 Governance must approve all mutations.
6.3 System, Engine, and Module layers are prohibited from writing to SSOT.
6.4 SSOT mutations must be deterministic, auditable, and reversible.
6.5 All mutations must be recorded in SSOT lineage.

SSOT Drift and Conflict Rules
7.1 SSOT drift is not allowed under any circumstances.
7.2 Any detected drift requires immediate system quarantine.
7.3 Engines must detect drift but cannot correct it.
7.4 Governance initiates drift correction processes.
7.5 SSOT conflicts must halt execution until resolved.

SSOT Propagation Rules
8.1 SSOT truth flows downward from Kernel to Modules.
8.2 No upward propagation is allowed from Modules or Engines.
8.3 System components must preserve SSOT without mutation.
8.4 Pipelines must not alter SSOT during routing.
8.5 All propagation must be deterministic.

Versioning Rules
9.1 SSOT Specification v1.2 introduces full lineage structure.
9.2 All components must migrate to SSOT v1.2 before enabling new features.
9.3 SSOT version misalignment invalidates dependent components.
9.4 Systems and Engines must declare SSOT version alignment in metadata.
9.5 Contract-level lineage must match SSOT v1.2 schema.
