Status: Stable
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: Kernel Specification

Purpose
The Kernel Constitutional Rules define the immutable laws governing the entire Prospera OS.
These rules apply to all layers, systems, engines, modules, contracts, pipelines, and integrations.
Kernel rules cannot be overridden, bypassed, or weakened by any component of Prospera OS.

Immutability Rules
2.1 Kernel rules are immutable and permanent.
2.2 Kernel rules cannot be modified by System, Engine, or Module logic.
2.3 No runtime component may violate, redefine, or reinterpret Kernel constraints.
2.4 All governance and system behavior must resolve in favor of Kernel rules.

Structural Rules
3.1 Prospera OS consists of five permanent layers: Kernel Layer, Governance Layer, System Layer, Engine Layer, Module Layer.
3.2 Layer boundaries are permanent and cannot be merged or collapsed.
3.3 Higher layers may reference lower layers only through approved contracts.
3.4 Lower layers must never reference or depend on higher layers.
3.5 Cross-layer drift is strictly prohibited.

Boundary Enforcement
4.1 Kernel defines non-negotiable boundaries for all components.
4.2 System Layer defines architecture but cannot execute logic.
4.3 Engine Layer defines executable logic but cannot access platform behavior.
4.4 Module Layer defines platform behavior but cannot store logic.
4.5 Any violation must be blocked by Governance immediately.

SSOT (Single Source of Truth) Requirements
5.1 All entities must carry a verifiable SSOT lineage.
5.2 Kernel is the root of the SSOT chain.
5.3 No component may generate state that contradicts the SSOT chain.
5.4 System, Engine, and Module components must declare their SSOT path.
5.5 SSOT violations are considered critical system errors.

Deterministic Behavior Rules
6.1 Kernel requires all system-level behavior to be deterministic.
6.2 Engines must maintain deterministic output given identical input and state.
6.3 Modules may include non-deterministic elements only through platform-specific definitions.
6.4 Pipeline routing must not introduce probabilistic drift.
6.5 Any nondeterministic component must declare its risk class.

Drift Isolation Rules
7.1 All forms of behavioral drift must be detectable.
7.2 Drift cannot propagate upward to System or Kernel.
7.3 Engines must isolate internal drift.
7.4 Modules must not generate uncontrolled drift from platform signals.
7.5 Governance must stop any drift propagation within the OS.

Phase-Lock Rules
8.1 Execution phases must follow the Kernel-defined order.
8.2 No system may skip, reorder, or insert phases.
8.3 Phase changes require Kernel and Governance approval.
8.4 Phase-Lock violations invalidate the operation.

Versioning Rules
9.1 Kernel version increments require a formal governance review.
9.2 Kernel v1.x defines structural evolution.
9.3 Kernel v2.x and above define architectural transitions.
9.4 All components must declare version alignment with Kernel.
9.5 Cross-version operation is forbidden.

Enforcement Rules
10.1 Governance Layer must enforce all Kernel rules.
10.2 No component may execute if violating Kernel rules.
10.3 Kernel cannot be bypassed through contracts or dynamic methods.
10.4 Violation requires immediate blocking, quarantine, and repair.
10.5 Kernel is final authority in all conflicts.
