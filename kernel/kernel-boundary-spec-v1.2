Prospera OS
Kernel Boundary Specification v1.2

File: kernel/kernel-boundary-spec-v1.2
Status: Stable
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: Kernel Specification

Purpose
This specification defines the non-negotiable boundary rules for all layers, systems, engines, modules, processes, and contracts within Prospera OS.
No component may cross, override, or weaken any Kernel boundary.
These constraints ensure structural integrity, deterministic behavior, and long-term system stability.

Permanent Layer Boundaries
2.1 Prospera OS is composed of five permanent layers: Kernel, Governance, System, Engine, Module.
2.2 These layers must remain independent and cannot be merged.
2.3 No layer may escalate its privileges beyond its assigned role.
2.4 All cross-layer communication must occur through approved contracts only.
2.5 No dynamic or runtime bypassing of boundaries is permitted.

Kernel Boundary Rules
3.1 Kernel is the highest authority and cannot depend on any other layer.
3.2 No component may modify Kernel logic.
3.3 Kernel files may not contain executable logic, runtime behavior, or platform definitions.
3.4 Kernel constraints override all system-level behaviors.
3.5 Kernel rules have absolute priority over Governance, System, Engine, and Module behaviors.

Governance Boundary Rules
4.1 Governance may reference Kernel but cannot modify Kernel.
4.2 Governance controls versioning, auditing, verification, and enforcement.
4.3 Governance must never include system or engine logic.
4.4 Governance may not invoke modules or platform behavior.
4.5 Governance acts as the enforcement authority for all Kernel-defined boundaries.

System Boundary Rules
5.1 Systems define architecture but cannot perform execution.
5.2 Systems may not contain logic, algorithms, heuristics, or platform behavior.
5.3 Systems must not reference modules or engines directly.
5.4 All System behavior must be enforced through Engine implementations.
5.5 Systems must remain deterministic and follow Kernel-defined structure.

Engine Boundary Rules
6.1 Engines execute logic but may not access platform behavior directly.
6.2 Engines cannot store global state or modify SSOT lineage.
6.3 Engines must isolate drift and follow deterministic rules.
6.4 Engines may not reference modules, drivers, or adapters.
6.5 Engines must remain fully replaceable and testable.

Module Boundary Rules
7.1 Modules define platform behavior but may not include logic.
7.2 Modules must not reference systems or engines.
7.3 Modules may only operate through capability definitions, platform bindings, and adapters/drivers.
7.4 Modules cannot affect Kernel, Governance, or System behavior.
7.5 Modules cannot introduce drift beyond their declared risk class.

Cross-Layer Contract Rules
8.1 All interactions must occur through formally defined contracts.
8.2 System–Engine contracts must be deterministic and unidirectional.
8.3 Engine–Module contracts must follow capability boundaries.
8.4 No direct System–Module interaction is allowed.
8.5 Violations must be blocked by Governance.

Boundary Violation Rules
9.1 Any attempt to cross boundaries is considered a critical system error.
9.2 Violations must trigger Governance quarantine and repair sequences.
9.3 No component may execute while in violation state.
9.4 Boundary violations cannot be suppressed or overridden.
9.5 Kernel retains final authority over all violation adjudication.

Versioning Rules
10.1 Boundary rules update only through Kernel version changes.
10.2 v1.2 introduces drift walls, deterministic constraints, and capability separation.
10.3 All layers must align with Kernel version before introducing new behaviors.
10.4 Boundary misalignment invalidates the component.
10.5 All components must declare version alignment.
