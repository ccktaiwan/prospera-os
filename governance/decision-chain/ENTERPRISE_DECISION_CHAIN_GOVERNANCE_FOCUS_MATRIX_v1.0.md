Prospera Enterprise Decision Chain Governance Focus Matrix

Document Type: Canonical Governance Mapping
Status: Canonical

Scope: Enterprise Governance Prioritization
Authority Level: Governance Layer

Purpose

This document defines the governance focus matrix that maps
enterprise internal control processes to the Prospera Governable Decision Chain.

Its purpose is to identify which decision steps require heightened governance control
for each enterprise process, ensuring proportional, risk-aware governance enforcement.

This document does not redefine the decision chain.
It assigns governance weight and attention.

Governance Principle

The seven-step decision chain is invariant and canonical.

Enterprise processes differ in risk concentration, not in decision structure.

Governance strength must be applied where failure impact is highest.

Enterprise Process Governance Focus Matrix

Legend
H = High Governance Sensitivity
M = Medium Governance Sensitivity
L = Low Governance Sensitivity
| Enterprise Process  | Intent | Context | Constraint | Option | Evaluation | Authorization | Execution |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------- | ---------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------- | --------- |
| Strategic Planning  | H      | H       | M          | M      | H          | H             | M         |
| Procurement         | M      | M       | H          | M      | M          | H             | H         |
| Finance & Reporting | M      | H       | H          | L      | H          | H             | H         |
| Human Resources     | M      | M       | M          | M      | M          | H             | H         |
| Compliance & Legal  | H      | H       | H          | L      | M          | H             | M         |
| IT & Security       | M      | H       | H          | M      | M          | H             | H         |
| Operations          | M      | M       | M          | M      | L          | M             | H         |
| Risk Management     | H      | H       | H          | L      | H          | H             | M         |

Interpretation Rules

H (High) indicates mandatory governance enforcement and escalation readiness.

M (Medium) indicates standard governance enforcement.

L (Low) indicates monitoring-level governance only.

No process may downgrade a step marked as High.

Governance Usage

This matrix is used to:

Prioritize governance enforcement in decision-chain mappings

Guide Kernel and System enforcement strictness

Inform Codex execution constraints and escalation thresholds

Invariants

No decision step may be removed or reordered.

Governance focus does not imply authority delegation.

Execution capability never overrides governance priority.
