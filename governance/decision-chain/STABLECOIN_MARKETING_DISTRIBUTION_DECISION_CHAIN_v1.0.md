Purpose

This document defines the canonical seven-step governable decision chain
for all stablecoin-related marketing, issuance promotion, distribution,
and incentive campaigns operating under Prospera OS.

It establishes enforceable governance controls to prevent misleading
communications, regulatory violations, incentive abuse, and AI-driven
market manipulation.

All marketing and distribution activities MUST comply with this chain.

Decision Scope

This decision chain governs:
- Public marketing campaigns
- Issuance announcements
- Incentive and reward programs
- Partner distribution agreements
- Multi-channel pricing and promotion strategies

Seven-Step Governable Decision Chain

Step 1 — Intent Declaration

A marketing or distribution intent MUST be explicitly declared.

Required:
- Campaign objective
- Target audience and jurisdictions
- Channels and mediums
- Incentives or rewards involved
- AI assistance disclosure (if any)

Undeclared promotional activities are prohibited.

Step 2 — Context Validation

System validates:
- Jurisdictional advertising restrictions
- Financial promotion regulations
- Target audience eligibility
- Incentive legality and disclosure requirements

Invalid context results in immediate termination.

Step 3 — Policy Evaluation

Governance policies are evaluated, including:
- Truth-in-advertising rules
- Risk disclosure requirements
- Incentive and referral limitations
- Fair pricing and anti-manipulation policies

Policy violations trigger a hard block.

Step 4 — Risk Assessment

System performs quantified risk assessment covering:
- Market manipulation risk
- Consumer deception exposure
- Regulatory enforcement likelihood
- Reputational and trust impact

AI MAY assist with analysis and forecasting
but MAY NOT determine campaign approval.

Step 5 — Authorization

Human authorization is REQUIRED.

Authorized roles may include:
- Marketing Governance Authority
- Compliance Officer
- Legal Review Authority

AI systems CANNOT authorize marketing activities.

Step 6 — Execution

Upon authorization:
- Campaign execution is performed via system-controlled workflows
- Content, pricing, and incentives are locked to approved parameters
- AI may generate materials only within approved scope

Any deviation triggers kernel hard fail.

Step 7 — Audit, Logging, and Recovery

All campaign activities are:
- Fully logged and attributable
- Time-bound and reviewable
- Subject to post-campaign compliance audit

Recovery procedures MUST exist for regulatory or reputational incidents.

AI Role Enforcement

AI systems are classified as Engineering Workers only.

AI MAY:
- Draft campaign materials
- Analyze channel performance
- Simulate audience response

AI MUST NOT:
- Launch campaigns autonomously
- Modify approved messaging
- Adjust incentives or pricing
- Target restricted audiences

Kernel-Level Enforcement

The following are kernel-protected prohibitions:
- Misleading or undisclosed promotions
- Unauthorized incentive programs
- AI-driven campaign execution
- Cross-jurisdiction promotion without validation
- Bypassing compliance approval

Violations trigger immediate hard fail and escalation.

Canonical Status

This decision chain is canonical for all stablecoin marketing
and distribution activities under Prospera OS.

Client repositories may not modify, bypass, or reinterpret this chain.
