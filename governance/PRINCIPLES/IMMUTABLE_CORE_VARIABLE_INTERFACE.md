Immutable Core / Variable Interface Principle

(Immutable Core, Variable Projection Architecture)

Status

Governance Principle

Structural Invariant

Non-Frozen

Non-Executable

Subject to Constitutional Violation Protocol

1. Purpose

This principle defines a non-negotiable structural invariant of Prospera OS:

Frontend interfaces MAY vary freely,
but the system’s core interpretation, governance, and truth resolution MUST remain immutable.

This invariant ensures that Prospera can scale across industries, roles, and interaction models
without semantic drift, governance erosion, or loss of system identity.

2. Conceptual Positioning

All Prospera frontends are projection layers, not system logic.

In their system role, Prospera frontends are conceptually comparable to
analytical projection interfaces such as Palantir or Power BI:

They expose governed realities through role-specific views

They adapt to domain, industry, and user context

They do not own semantic authority

They do not define truth

Frontend variability is expected and encouraged,
provided that core invariants remain untouched.

3. Immutable Core Definition

The following components constitute the immutable core of Prospera OS
and MUST NOT be altered, bypassed, or reinterpreted by any frontend:

Role Engine

Intent Engine

Semantic Engine

SSOT (Single Source of Truth) resolution mechanism

Project Lock

Task Lock

Phase / Shift Lock

Pass Lock

Pipeline–Thread–Container abstraction

Five-layer system structure:

Kernel

Governance

System

Execution

Generation

No frontend, interface, or client layer is permitted direct authority over these components.

4. Variable Interface Definition

Frontend interfaces MAY vary in:

Industry-specific terminology and workflows

Role-specific input and output forms

Interaction modalities (text, voice, visual, dashboard)

Narrative framing for different audiences

Presentation logic and UX design

Frontend variability MUST NOT imply variability of meaning, truth, or governance.

5. Input Interpretation Rule

All frontend inputs are treated as proposals, not facts.

Regardless of source, role, or authority, all inputs must pass through:

Role Engine

Intent Engine

Semantic Engine

SSOT resolution

No frontend input may directly mutate system state.

6. Output Projection Rule

All frontend outputs are treated as projections, not authorities.

Generated artifacts may include (but are not limited to):

Investor-facing documents

Legal drafts

Technical specifications

Research summaries

Visual assets or scripts

No generated output may be treated as a source of truth
unless explicitly re-ingested and governed through the immutable core.

7. Explicit Frontend Prohibitions

Frontend interfaces MUST NOT:

Alter or redefine SSOT

Redefine semantic meaning or intent resolution

Bypass governance, project, phase, or task locks

Merge or contaminate pipeline–thread–containers

Trigger system evolution or baseline migration

Escalate authority based on user identity or interface type

Treat generated outputs as canonical truth

Any violation constitutes a governance breach.

8. Governance Interpretation Rule

Frontend behavior is always subject to interpretation, never trust.

Any frontend action that appears to:

redefine meaning

collapse role boundaries

influence evolution or baseline elevation

must be evaluated under the Constitutional Violation Protocol.

9. Relationship to Other Governance Artifacts

This principle:

Does NOT define execution logic

Does NOT authorize automation

Does NOT belong to the Evolution Codex

Evolution Codex governs when Prospera may change.
This principle governs what Prospera must never become.

10. Core Assertion

Prospera OS may wear any interface,
serve any industry,
and speak to any role.

It must never change how it understands,
governs,
or preserves truth.
