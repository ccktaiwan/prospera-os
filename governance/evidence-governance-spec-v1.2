Status: Stable
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: Governance Specification

Purpose
The Evidence Governance Specification defines the rules, structures, and processes for collecting, validating, storing, auditing, and interpreting evidence across Prospera OS.
Evidence is required for version changes, migrations, contract updates, subsystem modifications, and any Kernel-relevant operation.

Definition of Evidence
2.1 Evidence is any verifiable data supporting a structural, behavioral, or version-related change.
2.2 Evidence must be deterministic, reproducible, and tamper-proof.
2.3 Evidence may not contain platform-specific heuristics or nondeterministic components.
2.4 Evidence must directly map to SSOT lineage.
2.5 Evidence must be stored in a canonical location defined by Governance.

Evidence Requirements
3.1 All system changes must include evidence.
3.2 All engine and module changes must include boundary validation evidence.
3.3 SSOT mutations require complete lineage evidence.
3.4 Any cross-layer operation must include contract evidence.
3.5 Drift detection requires explicit evidence records.

Evidence Validation Rules
4.1 All evidence must be validated by Governance before acceptance.
4.2 Evidence must reference the exact component version it supports.
4.3 Evidence must be free from ambiguity or interpretation.
4.4 Evidence inconsistent with Kernel rules must be rejected.
4.5 Evidence must not depend on nondeterministic execution paths.

Evidence Storage Rules
5.1 All evidence must be stored in immutable audit logs.
5.2 Evidence must not be stored in System, Engine, or Module components.
5.3 Evidence must include file origin, timestamp, change reason, and lineage ID.
5.4 Evidence must remain reproducible across versions.
5.5 Historical evidence cannot be altered or removed.

Evidence Lineage
6.1 Each piece of evidence must include a lineage reference linking back to Kernel SSOT.
6.2 Lineage inconsistencies must be treated as evidence corruption.
6.3 Evidence lineage must support full reconstruction of system state.
6.4 Evidence lineage must remain compatible with version governance.
6.5 All lineage must be deterministic and complete.

Evidence Categories
7.1 Structural Evidence: modifications to architecture, boundaries, or Kernel rules.
7.2 Behavioral Evidence: changes to logic, routing, or deterministic behavior.
7.3 Contract Evidence: updates to System–Engine, Engine–Module, or Module–Platform contracts.
7.4 Version Evidence: version increments, release notes, or compatibility updates.
7.5 Drift Evidence: detection, classification, and correction events.

Evidence Conflict Rules
8.1 Conflicting evidence invalidates the proposed change.
8.2 Evidence must not contradict existing SSOT lineage.
8.3 All conflicts must be escalated to Governance.
8.4 Conflict resolution requires new evidence supporting the correction.
8.5 Execution must stop until conflict resolution is complete.

Evidence Audit
9.1 Governance must maintain full audit logs.
9.2 Audit logs must remain immutable and cryptographically verifiable.
9.3 All components must be able to produce audit chains for verification.
9.4 Missing audit data must halt system execution.
9.5 Audit failures are considered critical violations.

Version Alignment
10.1 Evidence must declare version alignment to Kernel v1.2.
10.2 Evidence for outdated versions is invalid.
10.3 Version drift in evidence must trigger full remediation.
10.4 Evidence must reference the exact commit and contract version.
10.5 Evidence associated with deprecated components must be archived.
