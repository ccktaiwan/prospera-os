# Prospera OS — Governance Freeze Declaration

Status: Canonical
Version: v1.0
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Scope: System Governance Freeze
Authority: SYSTEM_INDEX
Effective Date: 2026-01-10

---

## 1. Purpose

This declaration formally freezes the governance architecture of Prospera OS
at version v1.0.

The freeze establishes a stable, auditable, and reviewable baseline for
system governance, authority boundaries, enforcement gates, and evidence rules.

This declaration introduces no new capabilities and performs no behavioral changes.

---

## 2. Freeze Scope

The following components are frozen as authoritative and canonical as of the
Effective Date:

### 2.1 Governance Gates

- Human-in-the-Loop Authority Gate (v1.0)
- Input Boundary Non-Bypassability Gate (v1.0)
- Evidence and CI Authority Boundary (v1.0)

### 2.2 Canonical System Documents

- SYSTEM_INDEX.md (v1.0)
- SYSTEM_MAP.md (v1.1)
- SYSTEM_COORDINATES.md
- Governance Decision Chain specifications
- Stage 01–05 canonical definitions

### 2.3 Enforcement and Verification

- Governance arbitration rules
- Enforcement actions (ALLOW / DENY / REQUIRE_HUMAN)
- Replay determinism requirements
- CI-based policy and replay verification constraints

---

## 3. Freeze Guarantees

As of the Effective Date, Prospera OS guarantees:

- No governance authority expansion
- No relaxation of enforcement constraints
- No introduction of implicit bypass paths
- No reclassification of CI outputs as authority
- No automation of human authority decisions

All governance decisions remain fail-closed by default.

---

## 4. Permitted Changes Post-Freeze

The following changes are permitted without violating this freeze:

- Documentation clarifications that do not alter semantics
- Non-governance implementation details
- Performance optimizations that preserve governance behavior
- Additive, versioned governance proposals explicitly marked as post-v1.0

Any change affecting governance behavior MUST:
- Increment the governance version
- Provide a formal migration and justification document
- Undergo explicit review and approval

---

## 5. Prohibited Changes Post-Freeze

The following are explicitly prohibited under this freeze:

- Modification of frozen governance gates without version increment
- Bypass or weakening of input boundary constraints
- Delegation or automation of human authority decisions
- Alteration or deletion of authoritative evidence
- Reinterpretation of canonical system roles

Violations invalidate system compliance claims.

---

## 6. Audit and Review Implications

This freeze enables:

- External technical due diligence
- Patent and intellectual property referencing
- Deterministic audit and replay verification
- Stable compliance assertions

Any review referencing Prospera OS governance MUST reference this freeze declaration.

---

## 7. Relationship to Future Versions

This declaration applies exclusively to Prospera OS v1.0 governance.

Future governance evolution MUST occur through:
- Explicit versioning
- Isolated proposal documents
- Non-retroactive application

Backward mutation of frozen governance is disallowed.
