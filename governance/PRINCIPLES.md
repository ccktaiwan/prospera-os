# Prospera OS Core Principles

This document defines the non-negotiable core principles governing all design, execution, delegation, and AI-assisted operations within Prospera OS.

These principles apply across governance, system architecture, execution workflows, and Codex-based generation.

---

## Principle 1 — Governance Before Execution

No execution, automation, delegation, or AI-generated output is permitted unless it is explicitly governed.

Governance defines:
- what may act,
- under what authority,
- within which constraints,
- and with what accountability.

Speed, intelligence, or autonomy SHALL NOT override governance.

---

## Principle 2 — Human Authority Is Explicit and Traceable

All authority within Prospera OS originates from explicit human intent.

AI systems do not possess implicit authority.
They act only under:
- declared scope,
- assigned role,
- defined limits,
- and reviewable outcomes.

Every action must be attributable to a human authority chain.

---

## Principle 3 — Canonical Rules Override Generated Output

Generated content, recommendations, or actions are always subordinate to canonical rules.

Where conflict exists between:
- human instruction and system rules,
- generated output and governance constraints,
- optimization goals and accountability requirements,

canonical governance SHALL prevail.

---

## Principle 4 — Separation of Thinking, Deciding, and Executing

Prospera OS enforces strict separation between:
- reasoning,
- decision authority,
- execution.

AI may assist reasoning.
Humans retain decision authority.
Execution occurs only within governed systems.

No component may collapse these roles.

---

## Principle 5 — Accountability Is Mandatory

Every execution must be:
- reviewable,
- auditable,
- reversible where applicable.

Untraceable or irreversible actions are prohibited.

Automation without accountability is considered system failure.

---

## Principle 6 — Scaling Requires Governance Maturity

No capability may scale unless its governance model is proven.

This includes:
- automation depth,
- delegation breadth,
- execution speed,
- system autonomy.

Scaling without governance maturity is forbidden.

---

## Principle 7 — Systems Exist to Preserve Human Judgment

Prospera OS is designed to protect, not replace, human judgment.

AI augments cognition.
Systems enforce structure.
Humans remain responsible.

Any system that obscures responsibility is invalid.
