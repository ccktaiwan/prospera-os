Governance Coverage Overview

This playbook governs three critical domains:

Together, these domains define the minimum governance surface required
to operate a trustworthy and compliant stablecoin system.

AI as Engineering Worker — Industry Enforcement

Across all stablecoin operations:

- AI systems are classified strictly as Engineering Workers
- AI may analyze, simulate, and generate artifacts
- AI may not authorize, execute, or override decisions

AI outputs are non-authoritative and subject to:
- System validation
- Governance authorization
- Immutable audit logging

Autonomous AI agents are explicitly prohibited.

Governance Priority Order

Within the stablecoin vertical, governance precedence is fixed:

1. Governance Authority
2. Legal and Regulatory Compliance
3. Monetary Integrity
4. Data Protection and Privacy
5. Market Fairness
6. Operational Efficiency

Lower-priority objectives may never override higher-priority constraints.

- Unauthorized data usage
- Unauthorized minting or burning
- Reserve misrepresentation
