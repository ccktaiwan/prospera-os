Purpose

This document defines the governable decision chain
for crisis and emergency scenarios affecting stablecoin operations.

It ensures that emergency actions remain lawful,
accountable, auditable, and immune to panic-driven or unauthorized execution.

---

Crisis Scenarios Covered

This decision chain applies to, but is not limited to:

- Peg deviation or loss of peg
- Liquidity shortfall or redemption surge
- Market panic or coordinated attack
- Critical infrastructure failure
- Regulatory enforcement action
- Data breach or security incident
- Cross-border compliance emergency

---

Seven-Step Governable Decision Chain

Step 1 — Crisis Signal Declaration

Intent:
"Declare a potential or active crisis affecting stablecoin stability."

Authorized Initiators:
- Human executive authority
- Compliance officer
- Risk committee

Inputs Required:
- Incident description
- Detected signals and metrics
- Time sensitivity classification

Block Condition:
AI systems cannot declare or escalate crises independently.

---

Step 2 — Crisis Classification and Severity Assessment

Classification Dimensions:
- Financial impact
- User impact
- Legal and regulatory exposure
- Systemic risk

Severity Levels:
- Level 1: Monitor
- Level 2: Controlled response
- Level 3: Emergency intervention

Block Condition:
Unverified or speculative assessments halt progression.

---

Step 3 — Action Boundary Definition

Permitted Actions:
- Temporary redemption controls
- Liquidity rebalancing
- Market communication
- Regulatory notification
- System isolation

Explicitly Prohibited Actions:
- Asset seizure without authority
- Undisclosed market intervention
- AI-initiated execution
- Irreversible actions without approval

Principle:
Minimum necessary action to stabilize the system.

---

Step 4 — Governance Authorization

Required Approvals:
- Crisis committee
- Legal and compliance validation
- Executive authorization
- Board-level approval for irreversible actions

Decision Outcomes:
Approve
Approve with limitations
Delay pending verification
Block

Block Condition:
Any action exceeding declared authority is blocked.

---

Step 5 — Kernel Emergency Enforcement

Kernel Controls:
- Enforce approved action boundaries
- Lock prohibited execution paths
- Freeze unauthorized modules
- Prevent AI improvisation or expansion

Emergency does not weaken kernel authority.

---

Step 6 — Controlled Execution and Communication

Execution Rules:
- Only authorized human operators may execute actions
- AI may assist in analysis or documentation preparation only
- All external communication must follow approved disclosure scripts

Execution must remain reversible where legally possible.

---

Step 7 — Post-Crisis Audit and Accountability

Audit Artifacts:
- Crisis timeline
- Decisions and approvals
- Actions executed
- Impact analysis
- Responsibility attribution

Outcome:
Lessons learned are fed back into governance updates,
not executed autonomously.

---

Canonical Outcome

This decision chain ensures that
even under extreme pressure,
stablecoin operations remain governed,
human-accountable, and legally defensible.
