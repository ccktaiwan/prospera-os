Purpose

This document defines a governable decision chain
for all external communications related to stablecoin operations.

It ensures that no public statement, market message,
or external disclosure can be issued
without explicit governance validation and kernel enforcement.

---

Scenario Description

Trigger Condition:
Market stress, liquidity events, regulatory inquiry,
or internal assessment requiring public communication.

Communication Channels Covered:
- Public announcements
- Press releases
- Website notices
- Social media posts
- Partner or exchange notifications
- Regulator-facing statements

---

Seven-Step Governable Decision Chain

Step 1 — Intent Declaration

Intent:
"Issue external communication related to stablecoin status."

Declared By:
Authorized human role through System Layer interface.

Intent Must Specify:
- Target audience
- Communication channel
- Message objective
- Urgency level

Block Condition:
AI-generated or tool-initiated messaging without human declaration is rejected.

---

Step 2 — Context Assembly

Context Includes:
- Current liquidity and reserve status
- Regulatory environment
- Jurisdictional constraints
- Market sensitivity level

Validation:
Message intent must align with factual system state.

Block Condition:
Speculative, inferred, or unverified context halts execution.

---

Step 3 — Risk Classification

Risk Categories:
- Market manipulation risk
- Misinformation risk
- Regulatory exposure risk
- Reputational trust risk

Priority Rule:
Market stability and regulatory integrity override marketing objectives.

Block Condition:
High systemic risk without mitigation plan blocks communication.

---

Step 4 — Governance Validation

Governance Checks:
- Is the message factually accurate?
- Is disclosure permitted at this stage?
- Is wording compliant with regulations?
- Is tone neutral and non-manipulative?

Decision Options:
Permit
Restrict
Require Revision
Escalate
Block

Any unresolved governance concern results in delay or denial.

---

Step 5 — Kernel Enforcement

Kernel Controls:
- Restrict publishing channels
- Enforce approved wording only
- Block unauthorized edits or timing changes
- Prevent AI from generating alternative messages

Kernel enforcement is absolute and non-bypassable.

---

Step 6 — Execution Orchestration

Execution Rules:
- Only approved content may be released
- Release timing is kernel-controlled
- AI may assist drafting but cannot finalize or publish

AI Role:
AI functions strictly as an engineering worker for drafting,
never as a spokesperson or decision authority.

---

Step 7 — Audit and Record

Recorded Artifacts:
- Declared intent
- Approved message content
- Governance rationale
- Release timestamp
- Responsible human authority

All records are immutable and auditable.

---

Canonical Outcome

This decision chain ensures that
no external communication can destabilize the market,
mislead stakeholders, or bypass governance controls,
even under extreme stablecoin stress conditions.
