Validation:
Only legally verified context may proceed.

Block Condition:

Step 5 — Kernel Enforcement

Kernel Controls:

Step 6 — Execution Orchestration

Execution Rules:
- Only authorized human representatives may communicate
- Communication must follow approved script or document
- AI may assist in drafting under supervision only

AI Role:
AI acts solely as an engineering worker for document preparation,
never as a legal authority or spokesperson.

Step 7 — Audit and Record

Recorded Artifacts:
- Regulatory request details
- Legal interpretation
- Approved disclosure scope
- Communication records
- Responsible human authority

All records are immutable and available for future audits.

Canonical Outcome

This decision chain ensures that
regulatory engagement is lawful, controlled, and auditable,
preventing accidental over-disclosure,
unauthorized statements, or governance breaches.
