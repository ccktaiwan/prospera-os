# README × Patent Alignment Decision

## Purpose

This document records a governance decision to align the public GitHub README
with the already-filed U.S. provisional patent for the Kernel-based Enterprise
Governance Operating System.

## Scope

This decision applies only to:
- Public-facing repository documentation
- README OS definition and system positioning language

It does not modify:
- The invention scope
- The provisional patent filing
- The attorney brief or claim strategy

## Key Principles

- The governance kernel is non-overridable and authoritative
- All execution, including AI-assisted generation, is subordinate to the kernel
- No specific AI model, Codex implementation, or prompt system defines the invention

## Outcome

- README OS definition finalized at the top section
- Codex positioned strictly as execution-layer behavior
- No changes required to patent filings or legal documents

## Reference

See GitHub Issue:
"Public repository narrative alignment with governance-kernel patent claims"
