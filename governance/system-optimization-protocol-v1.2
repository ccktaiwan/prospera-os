System Optimization Protocol v1.2

Status: Stable
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: Governance Specification

Purpose
The System Optimization Protocol defines the mandatory optimization workflow applied to all Kernel, Governance, System, Engine, Module, and Contract components.
This protocol establishes the nine-step optimization sequence required to maintain long-term structural consistency and prevent architectural drift.

Optimization Principles
2.1 Optimization is governed by Kernel constitutional rules.
2.2 Optimization must not modify Kernel content.
2.3 Optimization must remove drift, redundancy, inconsistency, or misalignment.
2.4 All optimization operations must be deterministic and reproducible.
2.5 Optimization may not introduce new behavior or logic.

The Nine Optimization Steps
This protocol formalizes the mandatory nine-step sequence:

3.1 Remove Mislayering
Identify and correct components placed in the wrong architectural layer.

3.2 Remove Misalignment
Correct role, classification, and boundary mismatches.

3.3 Remove Duplication
Eliminate redundant files, definitions, or logic fragments.

3.4 Fill Missing Components
Identify missing documents and generate complete specifications.

3.5 Standardize
Apply Documentation Style Guide v1.2 formatting and section structure.

3.6 Unify Terminology
Normalize naming, phrasing, and term definitions across all OS layers.

3.7 Remove Unauthorized Dependencies
Remove cross-layer calls, platform dependencies, or unstable linkages.

3.8 SSOT Reinforcement
Ensure all components sync correctly with the Prospera OS SSOT lineage.

3.9 Governance Reinforcement
Ensure all documents meet Governance validation and future-proofing rules.

Optimization Execution Rules
4.1 Optimization must always follow the nine-step global sequence.
4.2 Steps may not be reordered, skipped, or merged.
4.3 Optimization must pass Governance validation before acceptance.
4.4 Optimization must maintain strict System–Engine–Module boundaries.
4.5 Optimization must be checkpointed at each step for auditability.

Optimization Triggers
5.1 Kernel update
5.2 Governance update
5.3 System update
5.4 Engine update
5.5 Module update
5.6 Contract update
5.7 Drift detection events
5.8 Audit failures
5.9 Full-system migration cycles

Optimization Workflow
6.1 Governance initiates optimization.
6.2 System executes deterministic scanning.
6.3 Engines apply automated remediations.
6.4 Governance reviews outputs.
6.5 Kernel validates structural compliance.
6.6 Updated components must be version-aligned.
6.7 Final state must be recorded as SSOT lineage.

Output Requirements
7.1 All optimization must produce a structured Optimization Report.
7.2 Reports must include:
• components affected
• issues detected
• steps triggered
• remediation performed
• post-state validation results
7.3 Reports must be stored in immutable audit logs.
7.4 Each optimization must link to a corresponding commit batch.
7.5 Failed optimization cycles must trigger quarantine.

Version Alignment
8.1 This protocol aligns to Kernel v1.2.
8.2 All optimization cycles must upgrade affected files to version v1.2+.
8.3 Optimizations incompatible with Kernel v1.2 must be rejected.
8.4 Deprecated components may not be optimized.
8.5 Version mismatches must trigger immediate remediation.
