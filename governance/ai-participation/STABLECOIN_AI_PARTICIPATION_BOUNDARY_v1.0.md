Prospera OS — Stablecoin AI Participation Boundary
Document Type: Canonical Governance Specification
Status: Canonical
Version: v1.0
Date: 2026-01-05
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Authority Level: Governance Layer
Scope: Stablecoin Operations / AI Participation Control

Purpose

This document defines the explicit and non-overridable participation boundaries
for artificial intelligence systems within stablecoin operations governed by Prospera OS.

It ensures that AI functions strictly as an engineering worker
and never as an autonomous decision-maker, authority holder, or execution initiator.

---

Foundational Principle

Within Prospera OS, AI is institutionalized as an Engineering Worker.

AI may generate analysis, artifacts, recommendations, and simulations,
but possesses no authority, no escalation rights, and no execution privileges.

This principle applies universally and without exception.

---

Permitted AI Activities

AI systems MAY be used for the following activities:

- Market data aggregation and normalization
- Scenario modeling and stress testing
- Risk analysis and simulation
- Drafting of documentation and reports
- Preparation of compliance checklists
- Pattern detection and anomaly flagging
- Decision-support artifact generation

All outputs are advisory and non-authoritative.

---

Explicitly Prohibited AI Activities

AI systems MUST NOT perform any of the following:

- Declare emergencies or crisis states
- Approve, reject, or authorize actions
- Execute financial transactions
- Trigger minting, burning, or redemption
- Override governance or kernel constraints
- Modify system state or SSOT
- Communicate externally without human approval
- Initiate regulatory disclosures
- Escalate privileges or alter boundaries

Any attempt to perform prohibited actions must be blocked at the kernel level.

---

AI Invocation Rules

AI systems may only be invoked by:

- Authorized human operators
- System Layer processes operating under governance approval

AI systems may not self-invoke, self-expand scope, or chain autonomous actions.

---

Validation and Review Requirements

All AI-generated outputs must undergo:

- Human review
- Context validation
- Governance conformity checks

Unreviewed AI outputs are invalid for execution purposes.

---

Audit and Traceability

All AI-assisted activities must be:

- Logged with timestamps
- Associated with responsible human actors
- Traceable to originating requests
- Retained for audit and regulatory review

AI outputs without traceability are non-compliant.

---

Kernel Enforcement Requirements

The Kernel Layer MUST enforce:

- Hard blocks on prohibited AI actions
- Boundary validation on every AI invocation
- Isolation of AI from execution pathways
- Prevention of privilege escalation

Emergency conditions do not relax AI boundaries.

---

Canonical Outcome

This specification guarantees that AI participation in stablecoin operations
remains controlled, auditable, legally defensible, and human-accountable,
even under high-pressure or crisis conditions.
