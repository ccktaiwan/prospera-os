Version & Header Alignment Report v1.2

File: governance/versioning/version-header-alignment-report-v1.2.md
Status: Stable
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: Governance

Purpose

This report documents the normalization of version identifiers, header blocks, and file path declarations across all Prospera OS v1.2 documents.

The objective is to ensure deterministic version alignment, eliminate header drift, and guarantee machine- and human-verifiable consistency.

Scope

This report covers:

All Governance documents

All System Integration Protocols

All Engine Definition Sheets

All Module specifications

All Index and Terminology artifacts

No semantic content, interface definition, or behavioral rule was modified.

Alignment Rules Applied

The following alignment rules were enforced uniformly.

Each document header contains exactly the required metadata fields.

Document title version matches internal version references.

File path in header matches repository location exactly.

Kernel alignment references are consistent with v1.2.

No duplicate or conflicting version markers remain.

Normalization Actions
Header Block Consistency

Removed duplicated version strings in body sections.

Ensured single authoritative version declaration in header.

Standardized header field ordering across all documents.

Version Reference Alignment

Replaced legacy v1.1 references with v1.2 where applicable.

Ensured cross-document references point to correct versioned files.

Verified Kernel v1.2 alignment statements are present and consistent.

File Path Verification

Validated that each File: field matches repository structure.

Corrected casing and directory mismatches.

Removed outdated or alias file paths from headers.

Verification Summary

Documents reviewed: All v1.2 artifacts

Version mismatches detected: 0 (after normalization)

Header field violations: 0 (after normalization)

File path inconsistencies: 0 (after normalization)

Governance Statement

This alignment confirms that Prospera OS v1.2 documentation is fully version-consistent and header-compliant.

No further governance action is required for version or header alignment in v1.2.

Versioning

This report is aligned with Prospera OS Kernel v1.2.

Any future version update requires a new alignment report.
