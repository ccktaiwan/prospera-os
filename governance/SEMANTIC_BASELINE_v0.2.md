Prospera OS Semantic Baseline v0.2

This document declares Governance Formalization v0.2
as a frozen semantic baseline.

All governance definitions, authority hierarchies,
interpretation precedence, and enforcement semantics
defined under v0.2 are immutable.

Any modification to meaning, scope, authority,
or enforcement semantics requires:
- A new semantic version
- Explicit supersession documentation
- Governance Body approval

Minor edits, clarifications, or reformatting
must not alter semantic intent.

v0.2 is the reference baseline for:
- Audit
- Compliance
- Cross-repository interpretation
- External citation

No implicit semantic drift is permitted.
