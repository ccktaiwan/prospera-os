Status: Stable
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: Governance Specification

Purpose
The Governance Validation Protocol defines the mandatory validation procedures applied to all Kernel, System, Engine, Module, Contract, and Protocol files.
This protocol ensures that all components remain compliant with Kernel rules, boundary constraints, deterministic behavior requirements, and version alignment.

Governance Authority Rules
2.1 Governance is the execution arm of the Kernel.
2.2 Governance may enforce but not modify Kernel rules.
2.3 All violations detected by Governance must be escalated immediately.
2.4 Governance decisions override all System, Engine, and Module behaviors.
2.5 Governance is authorized to quarantine any component.

Validation Requirements
3.1 All new or modified files must pass Governance validation before acceptance.
3.2 Validation includes structure, metadata, terminology, and version alignment.
3.3 Cross-layer references must be verified against Kernel boundaries.
3.4 Drift detection must run automatically for all changes.
3.5 No file is exempt from validation.

Structural Validation
4.1 Documents must match the Documentation Style Guide v1.2.
4.2 Incorrect section numbers must be corrected automatically.
4.3 Missing File Location must be added.
4.4 Metadata must be complete and version-aligned.
4.5 End-of-Document block must be present and correctly formatted.

Boundary Validation
5.1 System documents may not contain execution logic.
5.2 Engine documents may not contain platform behavior.
5.3 Module documents may not contain logic.
5.4 Contracts may not bypass approved dependencies.
5.5 Any boundary violation results in immediate rejection.

SSOT Validation
6.1 All documents must declare SSOT alignment when required.
6.2 SSOT lineage must be preserved and non-conflicting.
6.3 Unauthorized SSOT modification attempts must be blocked.
6.4 SSOT drift must result in full remediation.
6.5 Governance must maintain full SSOT auditability.

Deterministic Behavior Validation
7.1 Systems must be deterministic.
7.2 Engines must produce identical outputs for identical inputs.
7.3 Stochastic behavior must be declared with risk class.
7.4 Pipelines may not introduce nondeterministic operations.
7.5 Modules must restrict nondeterministic platform behavior.

Version Alignment Validation
8.1 All components must align to Kernel v1.2.
8.2 Version mismatch invalidates the component.
8.3 Governance controls version progression.
8.4 Deprecated components must be removed or migrated.
8.5 All validated components must be recorded in version history.

Violation Handling
9.1 Violations trigger immediate quarantine.
9.2 Execution stops until the violation is fixed.
9.3 Governance initiates migration or remediation workflows.
9.4 After corrections, components must be revalidated.
9.5 Repeated violations increase component risk class.
