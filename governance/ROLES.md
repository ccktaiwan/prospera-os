# Roles and Responsibility Model — Prospera OS

This document defines the legal and operational roles within Prospera OS.

## Human Role

Humans are defined as:

- Final Authority Holders
- Non-delegable decision makers
- Ultimate responsibility bearers

Human authority:

- Cannot be overridden by automated systems
- Cannot be substituted by AI agents
- Is required for governance definition, approval, and escalation resolution

## AI Role

AI systems within Prospera OS are defined as:

- Execution Agents
- Non-sovereign actors
- Non-liable decision entities

AI capabilities:

- Execute tasks within explicitly granted boundaries
- Operate only after passing governance and control checks
- Must halt, escalate, or defer when authority is insufficient

AI systems:

- Do NOT possess final decision authority
- Do NOT hold legal or operational responsibility
- Do NOT reinterpret governance constraints

## Responsibility Boundary

All responsibility flows upward to human authority.

Execution does not imply ownership.
Automation does not imply accountability.

Prospera OS remains governable because authority is never automated.
