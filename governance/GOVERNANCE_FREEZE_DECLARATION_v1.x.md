# Prospera OS — Governance Freeze Declaration (v1.x)

Status: Canonical
Version: v1.x (Frozen)
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Scope: Governance Layer Freeze Declaration
Authority: SYSTEM_INDEX (SSOT)

---

## 1. Declaration

This document formally declares the Governance Layer of Prospera OS
version v1.x as **FROZEN**.

As of this declaration, all governance-related specifications,
authority definitions, and enforcement rules defined in Prospera OS
v1.x are considered complete, closed, and authoritative.

No further modification, extension, or reinterpretation of governance
behavior is permitted within the v1.x lifecycle.

---

## 2. Scope of Freeze

The Governance Freeze applies to all canonical governance components,
including but not limited to:

- Input Boundary Governance Layer
- Semantic Contract specifications
- Semantic Contract escalation tables
- Stage 01–05 governance pipeline
- System Coordinates arbitration model
- Enforcement adapter authority bindings
- CI / Replay verification gates
- Human-in-the-Loop Authority definitions

These components together define the complete and non-bypassable
governance responsibility chain of Prospera OS v1.x.

---

## 3. Prohibited Changes

The following changes are explicitly prohibited under this freeze:

- Altering governance authority boundaries
- Modifying escalation semantics or thresholds
- Introducing bypass paths or fallback behavior
- Reinterpreting AI execution roles
- Automating or proxying non-delegable human authority
- Weakening CI or replay verification requirements
- Redefining stage responsibilities or ordering

Any such change constitutes a violation of governance integrity.

---

## 4. Permitted Evolution

The Governance Freeze does NOT prohibit:

- Development of execution capabilities under existing governance
- Addition of new engines, modules, or interfaces that comply with
  frozen governance rules
- Capability-layer extensions designated as v2.0 or later
- Performance optimization without behavioral change
- Documentation or tooling that does not alter governance semantics

All permitted evolution MUST conform to the frozen governance layer.

---

## 5. Versioning Policy

- Prospera OS v1.x governance is frozen and immutable.
- Any governance modification requires a new major version
  (Prospera OS v2.0 or later).
- Capability extensions MAY evolve within v1.x provided governance
  remains unchanged.

---

## 6. Audit and Review Implications

This freeze establishes a stable governance baseline suitable for:

- External CTO and architecture review
- Patent examination and claim mapping
- Investment due diligence
- Compliance and audit validation
- Long-term system integrity guarantees

All reviews MUST reference this frozen governance state.

---

## 7. Authority Finality

This declaration is authoritative.

Any system behavior, documentation, or implementation inconsistent
with the frozen governance layer is non-compliant by definition.
