# Prospera OS Governance Canon

## Article 0 — Authority and Scope

Prospera OS is a governance-first enterprise execution operating system.

This repository defines the canonical rules, structures, and constraints by which
AI-assisted execution is authorized, limited, reviewed, and held accountable
within an organization.

The contents of this Governance Canon constitute the highest authority
within the Prospera OS system.

Where ambiguity exists between:
- human instruction and system rules,
- AI-generated output and governance constraints,
- execution speed and accountability requirements,

the Governance Canon SHALL prevail.

This repository exists to define how AI can be governed
before it is scaled, delegated, or automated.

No execution, automation, or delegation within Prospera OS
is considered valid unless it conforms to this Canon.
