Status: Canonical
Version: v1.0
Date: 2026-01-03
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Scope: Governance Capability Assessment and Progression
Authority Level: Canonical

Purpose

This document defines a governance maturity model for organizations adopting Prospera OS.

Its purpose is to provide a structured, auditable method to:

Assess current governance capability

Identify gaps and risks

Guide safe progression toward governed AI-assisted execution

This model is binding for governance assessment and adoption planning.

Core Principle

Governance maturity reflects enforcement capability, not intent.

Advancement is permitted only when structural guarantees are in place.
Skipping levels or retroactive justification is prohibited.

Maturity Levels Overview

Prospera OS governance maturity consists of five sequential levels:

Level 0: Ungoverned Execution

Level 1: Documented Governance

Level 2: Enforced Authorization

Level 3: Governed Execution

Level 4: Institutionalized Governance

Each level introduces mandatory controls that cannot be bypassed.

Level 0 — Ungoverned Execution

Characteristics:

AI-assisted execution without enforced authorization
