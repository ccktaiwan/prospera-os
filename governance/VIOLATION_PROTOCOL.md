# Constitutional Violation Protocol

This document defines the minimal and binding protocol
for identifying, declaring, and handling constitutional violations
within Prospera OS.

This protocol exists to ensure that governance authority
always supersedes execution, optimization, and generation.

---

## 1. Definition of Constitutional Violation

A constitutional violation is declared when any action,
system behavior, or proposal satisfies at least one of the following:

1. Attempts to modify or bypass a frozen governance codex
2. Triggers system evolution without explicit governance authorization
3. Performs baseline migration without a valid snapshot and review
4. Allows generation output to redefine governance rules
5. Introduces irreversible changes without rollback capability
6. Justifies evolution solely based on short-term success or performance

Effectiveness, efficiency, or competitive advantage
do not constitute constitutional validity.

---

## 2. Authority to Declare a Violation

Any of the following roles may declare a constitutional violation:

- Governance Authority
- Kernel or System Architect
- Designated Human Oversight Role

Declaration does not require consensus,
proof of failure, or outcome evaluation.

Suspicion of violation is sufficient to trigger a halt.

---

## 3. Immediate Effects of Declaration

Upon declaration of a constitutional violation:

1. All related execution, evolution, and generation processes MUST halt
2. System state MUST revert to the most recent valid baseline
3. No further action may proceed until review is completed

This halt takes precedence over schedules, objectives, or deadlines.

---

## 4. Review Scope and Constraints

The review process is strictly limited to answering:

1. Does the action violate any frozen governance codex?
2. Does continuation introduce irreversible or unbounded risk?
3. Is an RFC required to proceed lawfully?

The review MUST NOT consider:
- Performance metrics
- Speed of delivery
- Market pressure
- Strategic opportunity

---

## 5. Possible Outcomes

The review may result in one of the following outcomes only:

1. **Confirmed Violation**
   - Action is terminated
   - System remains at last valid baseline
   - Event is logged as a governance incident

2. **Rejected Declaration**
   - Halt is lifted
   - Rationale for rejection is documented

3. **Governance Gap Detected**
   - Action remains halted
   - RFC process is required
   - No execution may proceed until governance update is approved

---

## 6. Core Governance Principle

Prospera OS is designed to favor safety over momentum.

A system that cannot be halted
cannot be governed.

A system that cannot be governed
cannot be trusted.
