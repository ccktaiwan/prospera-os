# Governance Layer — Prospera OS

This directory defines the highest-order governance framework of Prospera OS.

All system design, execution logic, automation, delegation, and AI-assisted behavior
MUST conform to the documents defined here.

The governance layer is authority-first.
Where conflicts arise, interpretation flows strictly top-down.

---

## Governance Structure

The governance framework is composed of three tiers:

### 1. Governance Canon
**File:** GOVERNANCE.md

The Canon represents the highest authority within Prospera OS.

It defines:
- Final interpretive authority
- Precedence rules between humans, systems, and AI
- Non-negotiable constraints on execution, delegation, and automation

Where ambiguity exists, the Canon SHALL prevail.

---

### 2. Core Principles
**File:** PRINCIPLES.md

The Principles define the foundational values and operating constraints
that all systems, agents, and contributors must follow.

They translate the Canon into:
- Behavioral expectations
- Design boundaries
- Execution ethics

All lower-level documents MUST be compatible with these principles.

---

### 3. Governance Articles
**Directory:** (to be extended)

Articles are scoped, enforceable governance modules that define:
- Roles
- Responsibilities
- Decision rights
- Escalation and review mechanisms

Articles MUST NOT conflict with the Canon or Principles.

---

## Interpretation Order

When evaluating any instruction, output, or system behavior,
the following precedence order applies:

1. Governance Canon
2. Core Principles
3. Governance Articles
4. System-level specifications
5. Execution-level instructions

Lower layers may refine but never override higher layers.

---

## Scope of Applicability

This governance layer applies to:
- All Prospera OS repositories
- All AI-assisted execution
- All delegated or automated processes
- All contributors, human or artificial

No execution is considered valid unless it can be justified
within this governance framework.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this layer is not control for its own sake,
but to ensure clarity, accountability, scalability,
and long-term coherence of Prospera OS.

Governance exists to enable trust at scale.
