1. Purpose

This document provides explicit, approved examples of valid
Engine → Module invocations under Prospera OS.

These examples define what correct invocation looks like.
Anything not matching these patterns is not implicitly allowed.

2. Example A1 — Generation Proposal (Safe)

Invocation-ID: INV-EX-001
Engine-ID: Semantic-Generation-Engine
Module-ID: Structured-Output-Builder
Decision-Authority-Level: L2
Operational-Reality-Domain: A
Invocation-Phase: Generation
SSOT-Reference: Prospera-OS
Responsible-Human: Assigned

Result: PERMITTED

Rationale:
Pure representational output.
No execution, no state change, no escalation.

3. Example A2 — Execution Task Assembly (Bounded)

Invocation-ID: INV-EX-002
Engine-ID: Execution-Planning-Engine
Module-ID: Task-Orchestration-Module
Decision-Authority-Level: L1
Operational-Reality-Domain: B
Invocation-Phase: Execution-Preparation
SSOT-Reference: Prospera-OS
Responsible-Human: Assigned

Result: PERMITTED

Rationale:
Orchestration only.
No authority modification.
No real-world action committed.

4. Example A3 — Mobile Context Parsing

Invocation-ID: INV-EX-003
Engine-ID: Mobile-Context-Engine
Module-ID: Context-Normalization-Module
Decision-Authority-Level: L2
Operational-Reality-Domain: A
Invocation-Phase: Context-Resolution
SSOT-Reference: Prospera-OS
Responsible-Human: Assigned

Result: PERMITTED

Rationale:
Context interpretation within representational domain.
No decision authority exercised.

5. Example A4 — Time-Sequence Evaluation

Invocation-ID: INV-EX-004
Engine-ID: Temporal-Sequence-Engine
Module-ID: Event-Ordering-Module
Decision-Authority-Level: L1
Operational-Reality-Domain: B
Invocation-Phase: Validation
SSOT-Reference: Prospera-OS
Responsible-Human: Assigned

Result: PERMITTED

Rationale:
Sequence validation only.
No irreversible action.

6. Canonical Rule

These examples are illustrative allowlist references.

They do not grant blanket permission.
They demonstrate acceptable invocation patterns only.
