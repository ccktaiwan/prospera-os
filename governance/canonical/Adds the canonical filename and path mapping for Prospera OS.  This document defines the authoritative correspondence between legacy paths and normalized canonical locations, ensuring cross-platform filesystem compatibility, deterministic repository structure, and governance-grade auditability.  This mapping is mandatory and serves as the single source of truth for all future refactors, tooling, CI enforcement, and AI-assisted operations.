Prospera OS
Canonical Governance Scope Declaration

Version: v1.0
Status: Draft – Governance Freeze Candidate
Date: 2026-01-03
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Scope: Repository-wide
Authority: Canonical (Non-Overridable)

Purpose

This document defines the authoritative scope, authority boundaries, and governance role of the Canonical layer within Prospera OS.

The Canonical layer establishes what constitutes non-negotiable truth across the repository and serves as the highest reference point for system structure, filenames, paths, and governance-critical definitions.

No tool, automation, AI agent, or execution pipeline may override, infer, or reinterpret Canonical content.

Canonical Scope Definition

The Canonical scope includes, but is not limited to:

Canonical filename and path definitions

Authoritative system structure mappings

Governance boundary declarations

Non-overridable system definitions referenced by SYSTEM_INDEX.md

All documents under the Canonical scope are authoritative by definition.

Authority Boundary

The Canonical layer defines truth.
It does not execute actions.

Execution engines, tools, CI pipelines, and AI agents may:

Read Canonical documents

Validate against Canonical definitions

Report deviations or violations

They may not:

Modify Canonical content autonomously

Generate alternative interpretations

Apply corrective changes without explicit human approval

Canonical authority is absolute within its defined scope.

Change Control

All Canonical documents are append-only unless explicitly superseded by a higher-version Canonical document.

Any modification to Canonical content requires:

Human-authored change

Architecture Group review

Explicit version increment

Clear supersession statement

Automated tools may never alter Canonical documents directly.

Relationship to SYSTEM_INDEX.md

SYSTEM_INDEX.md is the single authoritative entry point for system discovery.

The Canonical layer provides immutable definitions referenced by SYSTEM_INDEX.md.

Where conflicts arise, resolution flows strictly top-down:

SYSTEM_INDEX.md  
→ Canonical Governance Documents  
→ System Definitions  
→ Execution and Tooling

Enforcement Principle

Governance precedes tooling.

Tools enforce Canonical rules.
Canonical rules never adapt to tools.
