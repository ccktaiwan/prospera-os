Purpose

This document defines the canonical market architecture for applying
Prospera OS governance to the stablecoin vertical.

It translates the stablecoin market from an economic concept into a
governable system architecture composed of explicit layers, risks,
decision boundaries, and authority constraints.

Any stablecoin system claiming compatibility with Prospera OS
MUST conform to this architecture.

---

1. Stablecoin Market Structural Layers

The stablecoin vertical is decomposed into the following layers:

1. Monetary Layer  
   - Issuance (mint)
   - Redemption (burn)
   - Supply control
   - Reserve alignment

2. Data Layer  
   - Customer identity data
   - Transaction records
   - Behavioral analytics
   - Compliance reporting

3. Market Interaction Layer  
   - Distribution channels
   - Pricing and incentives
   - Marketing campaigns
   - Partner integrations

4. Compliance Layer  
   - Regulatory interpretation
   - Jurisdictional enforcement
   - Audit obligations

5. Governance Layer  
   - Decision authority
   - Risk prioritization
   - Escalation paths

Each layer introduces independent risk and must be governed explicitly.

---

2. Stablecoin Risk Architecture (Seven-Layer Model)

Prospera OS classifies stablecoin risks into seven non-collapsible layers:

1. Governance Risk  
2. Regulatory Risk  
3. Monetary Integrity Risk  
4. Data Protection Risk  
5. Market Manipulation Risk  
6. Operational Risk  
7. Systemic Trust Risk  

Risk mitigation MUST follow this priority order.
Lower-layer optimization may not override higher-layer protection.

---

3. Decision Authority Mapping

Decision authority within the stablecoin market is strictly partitioned:

- Governance Layer  
  Defines what decisions are allowed.

- Kernel Layer  
  Enforces non-bypassable constraints.

- System Layer  
  Validates context and orchestrates execution.

- AI Components  
  Act only as engineering workers without authority.

Authority is never delegated to execution capability.

---

4. Mandatory Decision Chains

The following governable decision chains are mandatory:

- Stablecoin Data Usage Decision Chain
- Stablecoin Mint / Burn Decision Chain
- Stablecoin Marketing & Distribution Decision Chain

No stablecoin-related action may bypass the applicable decision chain.

---

5. AI as Engineering Worker — Market Enforcement

Within the stablecoin vertical:

- AI may analyze market data
- AI may simulate scenarios
- AI may generate engineering artifacts

AI may not:
- Make monetary decisions
- Approve data usage
- Execute market actions
- Override governance or policy

AI remains subordinate to governance at all times.

---

6. Client Implementation Boundary

Client repositories adopting this architecture:

- Implement systems under governance
- Do not redefine market rules
- Do not assert authority
- Are subject to audit and escalation

All authority remains in Prospera OS.

---

7. Canonical Status

This architecture is canonical for the stablecoin vertical.

Any ambiguity is resolved in favor of:
1. Governance Layer
2. Kernel Constraints
3. This Architecture Template

Absence of explicit permission implies prohibition.
