Purpose

This document provides an executive and regulatory overview
of the Stablecoin vertical implementation governed by Prospera OS.

It summarizes governance principles, decision controls,
AI participation boundaries, and audit readiness
without exposing implementation details.

---

What This Vertical Covers

This vertical applies to stablecoin operations including:

- Issuance and redemption
- Liquidity management
- Market stabilization actions
- Crisis and emergency handling
- Data usage and customer protection
- Regulatory reporting and audit

---

Governance Model Summary

Stablecoin operations are governed by Prospera OS
using a governance-first execution model.

Key characteristics:

- Non-overridable governance authority
- Kernel-enforced execution boundaries
- Human accountability at all decision points
- Explicit escalation and approval paths
- Continuous auditability

No action may be executed outside approved governance boundaries.

---

Seven-Step Governable Decision Chain

All significant actions follow a mandatory seven-step decision chain:

1. Intent Declaration
2. Context and Risk Assessment
3. Action Boundary Definition
4. Governance Authorization
5. Kernel Enforcement
6. Controlled Execution
7. Post-Action Audit

This structure ensures decisions remain lawful, traceable,
and immune to unauthorized or panic-driven behavior.

---

AI Participation Policy

Artificial intelligence is institutionalized as an engineering worker only.

AI may assist with:
- Analysis
- Simulation
- Documentation
- Risk modeling

AI may not:
- Make decisions
- Execute transactions
- Escalate authority
- Declare emergencies

All AI activity is reviewable, logged, and kernel-constrained.

---

Crisis and Emergency Governance

Emergency scenarios follow a predefined governance path.

Key principles:
- Severity-based classification
- Minimum necessary intervention
- Explicit prohibition of unauthorized actions
- No relaxation of kernel or AI boundaries
- Mandatory post-crisis audit

Emergency does not suspend governance.

---

Audit and Compliance Readiness

Stablecoin governance is continuously auditable.

Canonical audit artifacts include:
- Governance adoption declarations
- Decision chain records
- AI participation logs
- Kernel enforcement verification
- Crisis response documentation

Audit readiness is maintained by design, not retrofitted.

---

What This Vertical Is Not

- Not an autonomous financial system
- Not an AI-driven trading or issuance engine
- Not a replacement for regulatory authority
- Not a code-first or model-first solution

Governance precedes automation.
