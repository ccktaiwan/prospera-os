Governance Boundary Law v1.0

File: governance/governance-boundary-law-v1.0.md
Status: Stable
Owner: Prospera Governance Council
Category: Governance Specification

──────────────────────────────────

Purpose

The Governance Boundary Law establishes strict, immutable limits on the authority
and operational scope of the Governance Layer.

Its objectives are to:
• prevent governance overreach
• maintain layer purity
• ensure OS integrity
• protect kernel stability
• preserve deterministic execution
• isolate governance from runtime logic

Governance may supervise—but never execute—system or engine operations.

──────────────────────────────────

Scope

This law applies to all governance entities:

• Governance Council
• Evidence Authority
• Version Authority
• Oversight Board
• Review Committees

It constrains their interaction with:
• Kernel Layer
• System Layer
• Engine Layer
• Module Layer
• Pipeline
• SSOT

──────────────────────────────────

Immutable Governance Boundaries

The following boundaries cannot be crossed under any circumstances:

3.1 No Execution
Governance cannot execute logic, commands, or engine operations.

3.2 No Routing
Governance cannot modify routing tables or influence task sequencing.

3.3 No Logic Creation
Governance cannot create, modify, or delete system or engine logic.

3.4 No Architectural Influence
Governance cannot redesign Systems or Engines (only validate).

3.5 No SSOT Modification
Governance cannot write directly to SSOT; only Kernel may authorize updates.

3.6 No Intent Interference
Governance cannot modify user intent or override intent state.

3.7 No Direct Engine Access
Governance cannot access engine internals, memory, or states outside review scope.

3.8 No Module Interaction
Governance cannot invoke, direct, or configure Module behavior.

──────────────────────────────────

Authorized Governance Powers

Governance may perform the following non-invasive actions:

4.1 Validation
Ensure compliance with Kernel and Governance laws.

4.2 Evidence Oversight
Verify integrity, structure, signatures, and hash chains.

4.3 Version Control
Approve upgrades and migrations.

4.4 Violation Handling
Trigger freezes, reviews, or escalations.

4.5 Optimization Approval
Authorize the nine optimization actions.

4.6 Drift Monitoring
Review drift indices and anomaly reports.

These actions must not modify execution, routing, or system logic.

──────────────────────────────────

Governance Interaction Rules

5.1 Kernel Interaction
Governance may:
• interpret Kernel rules
• verify Kernel compliance

Governance may not:
• override Kernel
• modify Kernel files
• reinterpret Kernel logic

5.2 System Interaction
Governance may:
• validate System specifications
• audit System boundaries

Governance may not:
• define architecture
• change System contracts

5.3 Engine Interaction
Governance may:
• audit engine evidence
• validate engine outputs

Governance may not:
• adjust engine logic
• modify engine behavior
• invoke engine execution

5.4 Module Interaction
Governance may:
• audit module boundaries

Governance may not:
• operate modules
• configure modules
• influence module logic

──────────────────────────────────

Boundary Violations

Governance violates boundary law if it:

• performs execution
• modifies routing
• redefines architecture
• accesses engine internals
• bypasses Kernel
• directly alters SSOT
• influences user intent
• interacts with modules
• modifies logic outside governance authority

These violations are automatically classified as Constitutional Violations.

──────────────────────────────────

Enforcement Mechanisms

When a governance boundary violation is detected:

7.1 Immediate Freeze
Pipeline freezes all engine activity.

7.2 Evidence Capture
Full violation evidence is collected and anchored.

7.3 Governance Recusal
The offending governance entity loses authority pending review.

7.4 Kernel Arbitration
Kernel decides required correction actions.

7.5 Restoration
Routing and system state rebuilt from SSOT.

──────────────────────────────────

Prohibited Governance Behaviors

Governance must never:

• attempt to optimize performance
• alter execution flow
• reinterpret logic behavior
• write to subsystem states
• rewrite routing
• override safety constraints
• create new architectural concepts
• act as a System or Engine

──────────────────────────────────

Zero-Trust Model

Governance is treated as a “zero-trust actor,” meaning:

• all actions must be logged
• no implicit authority
• all permissions must be explicit
• all processes must be evidence-backed
• oversight is required for all governance actions
