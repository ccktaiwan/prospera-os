Version Governance Specification v1.2

File: governance/version-governance-spec-v1.2
Status: Stable
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: Governance Specification

Purpose
The Version Governance Specification defines the rules, processes, and constraints governing versioning across all layers of Prospera OS.
This document ensures version consistency, prevents incompatibility, and guarantees that all components evolve in alignment with Kernel-defined architectural principles.

Version Hierarchy
2.1 Kernel version determines the global OS version baseline.
2.2 Governance, System, Engine, and Module versions must align to Kernel version.
2.3 A version consists of major (X), minor (Y), and patch (Z) increments.
2.4 No component may advance its version independently of Kernel alignment.
2.5 Cross-version operation is strictly prohibited.

Version Categories
3.1 Kernel v1.x governs structural evolution.
3.2 Kernel v2.x governs architectural transitions.
3.3 Component v1.x indicates stable alignment with Kernel v1.x.
3.4 Component v1.1+ indicates migration to v1.2 style requirements.
3.5 Deprecated components must not receive version increments.

Update Triggers
4.1 Any Kernel update requires updates to all dependent layers.
4.2 Any System update requires corresponding Engine alignment.
4.3 Any Engine update requires Module contract alignment.
4.4 Module updates may not force System or Kernel changes.
4.5 Governance decides update necessity based on drift and validation results.

Version Migration Rules
5.1 All migrations must pass Governance validation.
5.2 Migrations must follow Kernel Boundary Specification v1.2.
5.3 No migration may introduce nondeterministic changes.
5.4 Migration must preserve SSOT lineage.
5.5 All migrations require formal commit messages and documentation updates.

Compatibility Rules
6.1 All components must maintain version compatibility.
6.2 Version drift invalidates cross-layer communication.
6.3 Contracts must match the exact version of their referenced components.
6.4 Deprecated versions must be blocked from execution.
6.5 Version mismatches require immediate remediation.

Deprecation Rules
7.1 Governance defines deprecated components.
7.2 Deprecated components must be labeled and moved to the deprecated directory.
7.3 Deprecated components may not participate in execution.
7.4 Deprecation requires a documented migration path.
7.5 Removal of deprecated components requires Kernel approval.

Release Management
8.1 Every major update requires a Release Note.
8.2 Release Notes must follow Kernel-compliant formatting.
8.3 All releases must define scope, affected layers, and migration steps.
8.4 No release may occur without full Governance approval.
8.5 Release versions must be globally unique.

Audit Requirements
9.1 All version changes must be recorded in an auditable log.
9.2 Audit logs must include change reason, impact, and boundary alignment.
9.3 Drift between audit logs and actual state must trigger quarantine.
9.4 Governance must maintain complete historical lineage.
9.5 All audit data must be immutable.
