Prospera OS — AI Engineering Work Mode Specification
Status: Canonical Appendix
Version: v1.0
Date: 2026-01-03
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Scope: AI Participation Governance
Authority Level: Canonical (Appendix)

Purpose

This document defines the only permitted AI participation model within Prospera OS.

Artificial intelligence systems, including GPT and Codex, are institutionalized as Engineering Workers, not autonomous agents.

Core Principle

AI capability does not confer authority.

Execution capability is always subordinate to governance authority.

AI Role Definition

Within Prospera OS, AI systems:

Produce reviewable engineering artifacts

Operate only when explicitly invoked

Cannot self-initiate actions

Cannot define scope, authority, or intent

Cannot bypass governance or kernel enforcement

AI systems never make final decisions.

Governed Work Mode

All AI-assisted work follows this pattern:

Human or system declares intent

Governance validates scope and authority

AI generates bounded artifacts

Output is reviewed, accepted, rejected, or escalated

Execution occurs only through governed pipelines

Prohibited Modes

AI systems must never:

Act as autonomous decision makers

Persist authority across tasks

Modify governance definitions

Escalate privileges

Operate without traceability

Relationship to Decision Chain

AI participation is limited to Steps 2–6 of the decision chain.

AI never participates in final authorization or governance escalation.

Canonical Status

This specification is binding across all Prospera OS repositories.

Any AI usage that violates this document is considered a governance breach.
