Prospera OS
Governance Constitution v1.0

File: governance/governance-constitution-v1.0.md
Status: Stable
Owner: Prospera Governance Council
Category: Governance Specification

──────────────────────────────────

Purpose

The Governance Constitution defines the permanent rules, authorities, constraints, and decision-making processes of the Prospera OS Governance Layer.
It serves as the foundational law for all governance activities, ensuring stability, consistency, transparency, and full alignment with Kernel Layer rules.

This constitution may not be overridden by any subsystem, engine, or module.

──────────────────────────────────

Scope

This constitution applies to:
• Governance Layer policies
• Oversight procedures
• Evidence and audit mechanisms
• Versioning and release management
• Cross-layer governance boundaries
• Algorithmic accountability

All governance documents must reference this constitution.

──────────────────────────────────

Core Governance Principles

3.1 Supremacy of Kernel
All governance actions must comply fully with Kernel Layer rules.
No governance entity may override or reinterpret Kernel laws.

3.2 Deterministic Governance
All decisions must be deterministic, repeatable, and evidence-based.
Stochastic or subjective decision-making is forbidden.

3.3 Transparency and Auditability
All governance outputs must be:
• logged
• time-stamped
• evidence-supported
• reproducible

3.4 Drift Prevention
Governance must detect, isolate, and correct any structural or behavioral drift across the OS.

3.5 Minimal Authority
Governance may only act within its explicit mandate.
No implicit or assumed authority is permitted.

Governance Responsibilities

Governance Layer is responsible for:

4.1 Oversight
Monitoring all systems and engines for compliance.

4.2 Validation
Ensuring all new components follow OS laws before deployment.

4.3 Evidence Management
Collecting and verifying all logs, proofs, and compliance records.

4.4 Version Governance
Controlling OS releases, signatures, approvals, and rollbacks.

4.5 Boundary Enforcement
Preventing cross-layer violations.

4.6 Algorithmic Surveillance
Tracking model behavior, anomalies, and abnormal output patterns.

4.7 Violation Handling
Triggering constitutional violation protocols when required.

──────────────────────────────────

Governance Powers

The Governance Layer is authorized to:

• approve or deny new engines
• validate system specifications
• request evidence from any subsystem
• freeze or suspend execution (Freeze Mode)
• initiate drift isolation
• enforce rollback
• require human review when safety conditions demand it

Governance may not:
• execute logic
• rewrite SSOT
• modify Kernel rules

──────────────────────────────────

Governance Entities

6.1 Governance Council
The highest decision authority.
Responsible for constitutional interpretation and major approvals.

6.2 Evidence Authority
Maintains audit logs, timestamps, and verification proofs.

6.3 Version Authority
Controls versioning, release gates, and rollback procedures.

6.4 Algorithmic Oversight Board
Monitors model behavior, anomalies, and safety deviations.

Each authority must operate independently to prevent concentration of power.

──────────────────────────────────

Decision-Making Process

All decisions must go through:

Proposal

Evidence Submission

Deterministic Evaluation

Compliance Check

Vote or Approval

Governance Signature

Publication to SSOT (if allowed)

No decision may skip steps unless explicitly allowed by Kernel.

──────────────────────────────────

Governance Boundaries

Governance may not:
• define execution logic
• modify system architecture
• intervene in engine routing
• bypass OS pipeline
• directly control modules

Governance may:
• monitor, audit, freeze, or rollback
• enforce rules
• validate artifacts

──────────────────────────────────

Violation Handling

A violation triggers:
• Automatic Freeze Mode
• Evidence capture
• Drift isolation
• Governance review
• Deterministic resolution

All violations must remain permanently recorded.
