PROSPERA GOVERNANCE
MINIMAL OPERATING RULES (MOR) v1.0

Document Type: Normative Governance Rule
Status: Canonical
Version: 1.0
Applies To: Entire Prospera Ecosystem
Authority Level: Governance Hard Stop
Change Policy: Exceptional Only

Purpose

This document defines the Minimal Operating Rules (MOR) for Prospera.

Its sole purpose is to prevent the following systemic failures:

Authority drift

Responsibility ambiguity

AI role overreach

Uncontrolled repository proliferation

If a rule does not directly prevent at least one of the above risks, it MUST NOT exist.

This document is intentionally minimal and final.

Scope

These rules apply to:

All Prospera repositories

All human contributors

All AI-assisted activities

All governance, execution, and documentation workflows

There are no exceptions.

Hard Stop Conditions

The following conditions are mandatory system-wide stopping points.
When triggered, ALL related activity MUST cease immediately.

No mitigation, workaround, or interpretation is permitted until resolution.

3.1 Hard Stop Condition 1: Authority Ambiguity

All activity MUST stop if any of the following occurs:

A repository README cannot answer, within the first screen:

Whether the repository is authoritative

Where its authority is derived from

Any discussion suggests that:

A non-authoritative repository may define rules

A document may be considered governance without explicit authority

Resolution Rule:

Do not add explanations

Do not debate intent

Immediately revert to Prospera OS definitions

3.2 Hard Stop Condition 2: Responsibility Unassignable

All AI-assisted activity MUST stop if the following question cannot be answered within 10 seconds:

“Who is the human responsible if this output is wrong?”

The following language is explicitly prohibited:

“The AI decided”

“The model suggested it”

“The system generated it automatically”

Resolution Rule:

Do not add new AI rules

Do not adjust prompts

Assign a specific human owner with responsibility

3.3 Hard Stop Condition 3: Repository Justification Failure

A new repository MUST NOT exist if it cannot be described in one sentence answering:

“This repository is not Prospera OS. It exists to do what?”

A repository MUST clearly belong to exactly one of the following categories:

Reference

Template

Validation

Sample

Resolution Rule:

Do not create repositories before classification

Do not defer justification

Unclassified repositories MUST NOT exist

Conditions for Introducing New Rules or Documents

New documents, rules, or processes MAY be introduced only if ALL of the following are true:

A governance misuse or responsibility risk has already occurred, or is imminent

The risk cannot be prevented using existing rules

The absence of the new rule creates a measurable governance failure

The following are NOT valid reasons:

Desire for clarity

External explanation

Completeness or elegance

AI Role Lock (Immutable)

Within Prospera:

AI is an engineering participant only

AI holds no authority

AI holds no responsibility

AI holds no final judgment power

Any system design that violates this principle constitutes a governance failure.

This rule is immutable.

System State Declaration

Upon adoption of this document:

Prospera OS is the sole governance authority

All other repositories are constrained roles

Governance is no longer maintained through document quantity

The system enters a maintenance and stability phase, not an expansion phase

Final Constraint

This document:

Does not require frequent version updates

Does not permit derivative documents

Does not permit subdivision into sub-rules

Its value is singular:

When complexity increases, this document determines whether work continues or stops.
