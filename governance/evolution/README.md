# Evolution Governance Codex

This directory contains the frozen governance constitution
that defines how Prospera OS is allowed to evolve.

Scope:
- Evolution governance only
- Baseline migration rules
- Dual-generation activation constraints

This codex is non-generative, read-only,
and binding to all system layers.
