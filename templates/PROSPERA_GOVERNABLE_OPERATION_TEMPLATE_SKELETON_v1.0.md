Prospera Governable Operation Template Skeleton

Document Type: Canonical Reference Template
Status: Stable
Version: v1.0
Date: 2026-01-03
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Scope: Cross-Functional Enterprise Operations
Authority Level: Governance-Aligned (Non-Authoritative)

Purpose

This document defines the canonical template used to model any enterprise operation
as a governable decision system within Prospera OS.

It provides a standardized structure for mapping business activities
to Prospera’s seven-step Governable Decision Chain,
ensuring that all operations remain auditable, accountable, and policy-compliant.

This template does not define governance rules.
It operationalizes governance already defined in Prospera OS.

Applicability

This template applies to, but is not limited to:

Sales and Marketing Operations

Procurement and Vendor Management

Financial Approval and Budget Control

Human Resources and Talent Decisions

Product Release and Change Management

Customer Communication and Support

Data Access and Information Security

Strategic Initiative Execution

Governable Decision Chain (Mandatory)

Every operation modeled using Prospera MUST follow all seven steps.

Skipping, merging, or bypassing steps is prohibited.

Step 1 — Intent Declaration

Purpose:
Define the explicit business objective triggering the operation.

Governance Controls:

Intent ownership identification

Scope and objective validation

Prohibited intent detection

Required Artifacts:

Intent statement

Business owner identification

Trigger context

Step 2 — Context Qualification

Purpose:
Determine whether the operational context allows the declared intent.

Governance Controls:

Policy applicability checks

Temporal and situational constraints

Dependency validation

Required Artifacts:

Context snapshot

Policy references

Constraint flags

Step 3 — Policy & Rule Evaluation

Purpose:
Evaluate intent and context against governance rules.

Governance Controls:

Compliance validation

Regulatory alignment

Internal control enforcement

Required Artifacts:

Rule evaluation results

Compliance status

Exception indicators

Step 4 — Risk & Impact Assessment

Purpose:
Assess operational, legal, reputational, and systemic risk.

Governance Controls:

Risk classification

Impact thresholds

Escalation triggers

Required Artifacts:

Risk profile

Impact analysis

Escalation recommendation

Step 5 — Human Authority Decision

Purpose:
Require explicit human authorization before execution.

Governance Controls:

Authority verification

Approval boundaries

Segregation of duties

Required Artifacts:

Approval record

Decision owner

Timestamped authorization

Step 6 — Controlled Execution

Purpose:
Execute the operation under enforced constraints.

Governance Controls:

Execution scope limits

Tool and AI participation boundaries

Real-time monitoring

Required Artifacts:

Execution log

AI participation record

Constraint enforcement report

Step 7 — Traceability & Recovery

Purpose:
Ensure full traceability and recovery capability.

Governance Controls:

Audit readiness

AI Participation Rules (Invariant)

AI systems may assist in analysis, drafting, and execution preparation.

AI systems may not:

Authorize actions

Override governance decisions

Bypass human accountability

Act without explicit invocation

AI outputs are advisory and reviewable.

Template Usage Rules

All seven steps MUST be present.

Each step MUST produce artifacts.

Absence of artifacts equals governance failure.

Customization is allowed only at the artifact level, not at the step level.

Relationship to Prospera OS

This template derives authority from Prospera OS governance definitions.

It does not redefine:

Governance rules

Authority ownership

Kernel enforcement logic
