Prospera OS — Canonical Generation Layer
Document Type: Canonical Layer Declaration
Authority Level: Prospera OS (Governance Kernel)
Status: Canonical (Approved)
Version: v1.0.0
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Last Updated: 2026-01-07
Scope: Formal recognition and governance alignment of the Prospera Generation Layer

---

## 1. Purpose

This document formally declares the Prospera Generation Layer as a Canonical Layer
recognized and governed by Prospera OS.

The Generation Layer is responsible for transforming validated intent and context
into deterministic, execution-ready requests, while explicitly excluding execution,
governance, authorization, and risk ownership responsibilities.

---

## 2. Canonical Layer Definition

The Prospera Generation Layer is defined as:

- A contract-first generation specification
- A deterministic transformation layer between intent and execution
- A non-autonomous, non-executing layer producing execution-ready artifacts
- A machine-verifiable layer enforced via schemas, examples, and CI validation

The Generation Layer MUST NOT be interpreted as an execution engine, policy engine,
or decision authority.

---

## 3. Responsibilities and Authority Boundaries

### Generation Layer Responsibilities
The Generation Layer is authorized to:
- Consume validated intent and contextual inputs
- Produce deterministic, schema-compliant execution requests
- Enforce structural and semantic correctness of generated tasks
- Emit generation artifacts suitable for direct consumption by the Execution Layer

### Explicit Non-Responsibilities
The Generation Layer is NOT authorized to:
- Execute tasks or trigger execution
- Perform governance or policy decisions
- Perform authorization or permission checks
- Assume or accept risk
- Modify execution behavior after request generation

All such responsibilities remain under Prospera OS authority.

---

## 4. Contract Surfaces

The Generation Layer is governed through the following canonical contract surfaces:

- Generation Task Schema  
  Repository: prospera-generation-layer  
  Path: schemas/generation_task.schema.json

- Generation Result Schema  
  Repository: prospera-generation-layer  
  Path: schemas/generation_result.schema.json

- Generation Boundary Specification  
  Repository: prospera-generation-layer  
  Path: principles/EP-05-generation-boundary.md

These contracts are immutable once released and MUST be consumed without reinterpretation.

---

## 5. Validation and Enforcement

Prospera OS recognizes the Generation Layer as compliant only if:

- All canonical schemas remain machine-verifiable
- All validation examples pass CI enforcement
- No generation behavior exceeds declared responsibility boundaries

Any violation invalidates canonical compliance.

---

## 6. Versioning and Change Governance

- Backward-incompatible changes require a major version increment.
- Backward-compatible extensions require a minor version increment.
- All changes must be reviewed under Prospera OS governance procedures.

---

## 7. Compliance Statement

Any implementation, generator, or downstream system claiming compatibility with the
Prospera Generation Layer MUST adhere to this declaration and all referenced
canonical contracts.

Prospera OS reserves the authority to revoke canonical status in case of
non-compliance.
