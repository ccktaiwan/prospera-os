Prospera Repository Topology Declaration

This document defines the authoritative relationship between repositories
within the Prospera ecosystem.

Authoritative Governance Source

The repository `prospera-os` is the sole authoritative source of governance,
semantic baselines, execution constraints, and escalation rules.

All governance definitions, interpretation precedence, and enforcement logic
originate exclusively from this repository.

Supporting Repositories

The following repositories are explicitly non-authoritative:

1. prospera-intelligence
   - Purpose: Human-centric intelligence, philosophy, cognition, and ethics
   - Scope: Conceptual and contextual only
   - Governance Authority: None

2. ai-governed-software-engineering
   - Purpose: Engineering whitepaper and applied reference
   - Scope: Demonstrative and explanatory
   - Governance Authority: None

Binding Rule

No document, definition, or interpretation in supporting repositories
may override, reinterpret, or extend governance defined in `prospera-os`.

In case of conflict, ambiguity, or omission, `prospera-os` always takes precedence.

This topology is invariant unless explicitly versioned and approved
by the Prospera Governance Body.
