Prospera OS
Generation System Specification v1.2

File: system/generation-system-spec-v1.2
Status: Stable
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: System Specification

Purpose
The Generation System defines the rules, boundaries, and structural requirements for producing deterministic outputs across all Prospera OS components.
This system governs how text, plans, documents, code, and system responses are generated in a stable, interpretable, and version-aligned manner.

Scope
2.1 Specifies generation schemas, constraints, and structural requirements.
2.2 The Generation Engine performs all generative logic.
2.3 Modules may provide platform constraints but never generation logic.
2.4 The system must follow Kernel v1.2 and Governance enforcement.

Generation Principles
3.1 All generation must be deterministic for identical inputs.
3.2 Generative behavior may not rely on platform randomness.
3.3 Generation must remain aligned with OS identity, intent, and context.
3.4 No system may bypass Generation System rules.
3.5 All generation must be auditable and traceable.

Generation Structure
Each generated output must include:
4.1 Output Type
• text, plan, document, code, protocol, etc.
4.2 Identity Reference
• ties generation to the Identity System
4.3 Intent Reference
• maps the output to canonical intent
4.4 System Context
• subsystem data needed for output construction
4.5 Lineage Metadata
• deterministic evidence of generation steps

Output Classes
5.1 Structured Output
• documents, specifications, code, reports
5.2 Instructional Output
• step-by-step flows, command sequences
5.3 Conversational Output
• responses within session boundaries
5.4 System Output
• internal messages, routing analysis
5.5 Meta Output
• architecture-level or governance-level constructs

Generation Constraints
6.1 Output must follow Documentation Style Guide v1.2 if applicable.
6.2 No output may contain unauthorized platform behavior.
6.3 All generation must reflect System Layer definitions.
6.4 No drift from Identity, Intent, or Context is permitted.
6.5 Rewriting, summarizing, or reformatting must preserve lineage.

Generation Operations
7.1 Create
• new output generated through deterministic rules
7.2 Rewrite
• restructuring allowed but must preserve lineage
7.3 Expand
• must follow intent and subsystem boundaries
7.4 Reduce
• must not remove required structural elements
7.5 Validate
• Governance must validate high-impact system outputs

Subsystem Relationships
8.1 Memory System provides context for generation.
8.2 Intent System determines the generation path.
8.3 Identity System provides lineage associations.
8.4 Execution System validates downstream actions.
8.5 Pipeline System routes generation outcomes.

Governance Enforcement
9.1 All generation outputs must align with Kernel rules.
9.2 Generation that violates safety must be halted.
9.3 Generation drift must be recorded as evidence.
9.4 Version mismatches require remediation.
9.5 Generative outputs affecting OS structure require Governance approval.

Version Alignment
10.1 Must align with Kernel v1.2.
10.2 Must reference Generation Engine v1.2.
10.3 Deprecated generation templates must be blocked.
10.4 Migration from v1.1 requires full structure update.
10.5 All generation must follow version-coherent schemas.
