# Prospera OS — Canonical System Index

Status: Canonical
Version: v1.1
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Scope: System-Level Index
Authority: Root (Single Source of Truth)

## Authority Statement

This document is the sole authoritative index for Prospera OS.

All system components, governance layers, execution stages, engines,
modules, interfaces, artifacts, and intellectual property references
MUST be explicitly indexed herein.

Any document, directory, repository, or artifact not referenced in this
index is NON-CANONICAL and holds no system authority.

## System Identity

Prospera OS is a governance-first enterprise execution operating system.

It enforces mandatory, non-bypassable control over execution and
generation actions in AI-assisted environments to preserve organizational
accountability and determinism.

Prospera OS is not a product, framework, toolkit, or agent system.

## Canonical Architecture Overview

Prospera OS consists of a five-stage governance pipeline preceded by a
mandatory Input Boundary Governance Layer.

The authoritative responsibility order is as follows:

- Input Boundary Governance Layer (Pre-Stage, Mandatory)
- Stage 01: System Boundary Definition
- Stage 02: Governance Formalization
- Stage 03: Invocation Validation
- Stage 04: Execution Binding
- Stage 05: Generation and Output Surface

No alternative ordering or interpretation is valid.

## Input Boundary Governance Layer (Canonical)

Path:
architecture/INPUT_BOUNDARY_GOVERNANCE_LAYER.md

Authority Role:

The Input Boundary Governance Layer guarantees semantic integrity of all
inputs prior to admission into the Stage 01–05 governance pipeline.

This layer is mandatory and non-bypassable.

It performs no execution, generation, or arbitration.

It prevents unauthorized linguistic, script, modal, or semantic
transformation of inputs.

Any input failing this layer is denied admission to Prospera OS.

## Authority Rules

- SYSTEM_INDEX is the exclusive authority for system discovery.
- Governance authority supersedes all downstream layers.
- Absence from this index implies non-existence at the system level.
- Governance decisions are invalid if input integrity is compromised.
