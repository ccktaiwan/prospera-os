# Prospera OS — Canonical System Index

Status: Canonical  
Version: v1.1  
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group  
Scope: System-Level Index  
Authority: Root (Single Source of Truth)

---

## Authority Statement

This document is the sole authoritative index for Prospera OS.

All system components, governance layers, execution stages, engines,
modules, interfaces, artifacts, validation runs, and intellectual
property references MUST be explicitly indexed in this document.

Any document, directory, repository, or artifact not referenced herein
is NON-CANONICAL and holds no system authority.

This index serves as the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) for:

- System discovery
- Governance enforcement
- Execution legitimacy
- Audit and replay validation
- External due diligence interpretation

---

## System Identity

Prospera OS is a governance-first enterprise execution operating system.

It enforces mandatory, non-bypassable control over execution and
generation actions in AI-assisted environments to preserve:

- Organizational accountability
- Deterministic behavior
- Evidence-backed decision-making

Prospera OS is NOT:

- A product
- A framework
- A toolkit
- An autonomous agent system

Prospera OS defines **how execution is permitted**, not **what execution
does**.

---

## Canonical Architecture Overview

Prospera OS is structured as a strictly ordered governance pipeline
preceded by a mandatory pre-admission layer.

The authoritative responsibility order is fixed and non-negotiable.

### Canonical Responsibility Order

1. **Input Boundary Governance Layer** (Pre-Stage, Mandatory)
2. **Stage 01 — System Boundary Definition**
3. **Stage 02 — Governance Formalization**
4. **Stage 03 — Invocation Validation**
5. **Stage 04 — Execution Binding**
6. **Stage 05 — Generation and Output Surface**

No alternative ordering, collapsing, parallelization, or reinterpretation
is valid.

## Input Boundary Governance Layer (Canonical)

Path:  
`architecture/INPUT_BOUNDARY_GOVERNANCE_LAYER.md`

### Authority Role

The Input Boundary Governance Layer is a mandatory pre-admission control
layer positioned upstream of all governance stages.

Its sole responsibility is to guarantee **semantic integrity** of all
inputs prior to their admission into the Stage 01–05 governance pipeline.

This layer:

- Performs NO execution
- Performs NO generation
- Performs NO arbitration
- Performs NO decision-making

### Enforced Guarantees

The Input Boundary Governance Layer enforces:

- Preservation of original language, script, and modality
- Explicit detection of missing or ambiguous metadata
- Prevention of implicit translation or normalization
- Rejection of semantically compromised inputs

Any input failing this layer is **denied admission** to Prospera OS and
MUST NOT proceed to Stage 01.

Governance decisions derived from compromised input integrity are
INVALID by definition.

---

## Governance Stages (Canonical)

### Stage 01 — System Boundary Definition

Defines whether the input is within the declared scope of the system,
including domain, authority surface, and execution eligibility.

### Stage 02 — Governance Formalization

Binds applicable governance rules, policies, escalation requirements,
and human-in-the-loop constraints.

### Stage 03 — Invocation Validation

Validates invocation legitimacy, completeness, and authorization
against formalized governance.

### Stage 04 — Execution Binding

Determines whether execution may proceed, must escalate, or must be
denied. No execution may occur without a valid binding.

### Stage 05 — Generation and Output Surface

Allows generation or output delivery strictly as a consequence of an
authorized execution binding.

Stage 05 performs no governance and holds no authority.

## Authority Rules (Global)

- SYSTEM_INDEX is the exclusive authority for system discovery.
- Governance authority supersedes all downstream layers and components.
- No module, engine, or workflow may bypass governance stages.
- Absence from this index implies non-existence at the system level.
- Governance decisions are invalid if input integrity is compromised.
- Validation and runtime evidence are authoritative only when governed
  under declared governance status.

---

## Canonical Interpretation Rule

In the event of ambiguity, conflict, or competing documentation:

**This index prevails.**
