Prospera OS
Execution System Specification v1.2

File: system/execution-system-spec-v1.2
Status: Stable
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: System Specification

Purpose
The Execution System defines the structural rules, constraints, and lifecycle for executing actions, plans, commands, and system operations within Prospera OS.
Execution ensures that actions are deterministic, validated, safe, and aligned with system intent and Kernel boundaries.

Scope
2.1 Governs the execution lifecycle, execution states, and action validation.
2.2 Defines execution schemas; Execution Engine performs actual logic.
2.3 Modules may provide platform APIs but may not execute or validate actions.
2.4 All execution behavior must comply with Kernel v1.2 and Governance rules.

Execution Principles
3.1 All execution must be deterministic and reproducible.
3.2 Execution may not start without confirmed identity and intent.
3.3 Safety overrides execution at all times.
3.4 Execution may not bypass subsystem boundaries.
3.5 Execution must be logged, auditable, and lineage-linked.

Execution Structure
Each execution cycle must contain:
4.1 Action Type
• operational, generative, routing, system, or external
4.2 Execution Context
• structured data required for execution
4.3 Preconditions
• identity, intent, safety class, and model readiness
4.4 Effects
• deterministic changes expected after execution
4.5 Lineage
• full trace linking to identity, intent, and generation

Execution Lifecycle
5.1 Initialization
• validate identity, intent, model, safety, and pipeline readiness
5.2 Validation
• Governance and Safety perform checks
5.3 Execution
• deterministic application of the action
5.4 Post-Validation
• verify effect, safety state, and system consistency
5.5 Completion
• store lineage and audit data

Execution Constraints
6.1 No action may execute without passing safety validation.
6.2 Execution must fail closed (failure is safer than uncertainty).
6.3 Unauthorized execution contexts must be rejected.
6.4 Engines may not execute actions outside their scope.
6.5 Modules may not perform any form of execution.

Execution Types
7.1 Internal Execution
• system-level operations
7.2 Generative Execution
• large-structure generation (documents, plans, specs)
7.3 Routing Execution
• pipeline-triggered transitions
7.4 Integration Execution
• cross-module interactions
7.5 Governance Execution
• remediations, migrations, enforcement actions

Subsystem Relationships
8.1 Intent System determines which execution path is valid.
8.2 Safety System validates each execution state.
8.3 Memory System provides contextual data.
8.4 Modeling System determines personal or session constraints.
8.5 Pipeline System orchestrates execution sequences.

Governance Enforcement
9.1 Execution violating Kernel or Governance rules must halt immediately.
9.2 All high-impact executions require Governance approval.
9.3 Drift during execution must trigger quarantine.
9.4 Audit logs must include full execution lineage.
9.5 Inconsistent execution results require remediation.

Version Alignment
10.1 Execution System must align with Kernel v1.2.
10.2 Deprecated execution schemas must be blocked.
10.3 Execution Engine v1.2 must be used for all logic.
10.4 Version drift invalidates execution contexts.
10.5 Migration requires full lifecycle alignment updates.
