Prospera OS
Application System Specification v1.0

File: system/application/application-system-v1.0.md
Status: Stable
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: System Specification

────────────────────────────────

1. Purpose

The Application System defines the top-level execution environment for user-facing tasks within Prospera OS.
It determines how applications are structured, validated, executed, monitored, and completed under full governance, safety, and routing constraints of the OS.

It is the highest abstraction layer within the System Layer and serves as the boundary between user intent, subsystem orchestration, and module-level platform execution.

────────────────────────────────

2. Scope

The Application System governs:

Application definitions

Application lifecycle

Application-level execution rules

Cross-system task orchestration

Safety and governance compliance

Integration with Engines and Modules

Auditable completion output

Fail-safe fallback and recovery behavior

It does not implement functional logic itself.
All execution is delegated to Engines and Modules through the System Layer.

────────────────────────────────

3. Position in Prospera OS

Kernel Layer ↓
Governance Layer ↓
System Layer → Application System
Engine Layer ↓
Module Layer

The Application System:

Receives validated Intent from the Intent System

Uses User Modeling System for personalization

Delegates flow control to the Orchestration System

Relies on Safety System for pre-/mid-/post-execution checks

Generates auditable output for SSOT

────────────────────────────────

4. Architectural Model

The Application System follows a five-phase lifecycle:

Application Definition Phase
Parse and validate the incoming task as an “Application Unit” (AU).

Preparation Phase
Bind AU with proper subsystems: Identity, Intent, Safety, User Modeling, Memory, and Routing.

Execution Phase
No direct logic allowed; delegates to Engines through Orchestration and Execution Systems.

Verification Phase
Perform governance and safety validation on the generated results.

Completion Phase
Produce the final, governed, SSOT-aligned application output.

────────────────────────────────

5. Application Unit (AU) Specification

Every user task is converted into an Application Unit (AU) with the following fields:

AU.id

AU.identity context

AU.intent bundle

AU.user model snapshot

AU.required subsystems

AU.routing plan

AU.safety envelope

AU.memory window

AU.governance state

AU.execution contract

AU.audit block

AUs are immutable after creation unless authorized by Governance.

────────────────────────────────

6. Interfaces
6.1 Input Interfaces

The Application System accepts only:

Intent System output

SSOT-approved system calls

Governance-validated internal triggers

No free-form tasks or module-level calls are accepted.

6.2 Output Interfaces

The Application System outputs:

Execution contracts to the Execution System

Routing plans to the Routing System

Application logs to the SSOT System

Final output to Modules via the Module Layer

────────────────────────────────

7. Execution Contract Model

Each Application Unit generates an Execution Contract (EC) containing:

Allowed systems and engines

Forbidden pathways

Safety and governance flags

Required memory scope

Expected output formats

Error-handling instructions

Recovery and fallback plan

Routing constraints

ECs are governed objects and cannot be mutated mid-execution.

────────────────────────────────

8. Safety Envelope

The Application System mandates a three-stage safety enforcement model:

Pre-execution safety
Validate intent, identity, model prediction, routing legality, and constraints.

Mid-execution safety
Continuous evaluation of engine behavior, drift detection, and anomaly detection.

Post-execution safety
Check for violations, hallucination deviations, routing violations, or SSOT mismatch.

Failure at any stage triggers:

Backtracking System

Recovery System

Safety System escalation

Governance audit

────────────────────────────────

9. Governance Integration

The Application System fully integrates with:

9.1 Version Governance

Check AU version, subsystem version, and execution path version.

9.2 Evidence Governance

Attach minimal evidence for every AU execution.

9.3 Policy Governance

Ensure application rules conform to Kernel and Governance policies.

9.4 Drift Governance

Detect deviations from Intent, Model, Safety, and Execution contracts.

────────────────────────────────

10. Prohibited Behaviors

The Application System must not:

Execute functional logic directly

Bypass Engines or Modules

Modify identity or intent

Write to Kernel

Call Modules directly

Produce non-auditable output

Create self-modifying applications

Generate routing decisions without Routing System approval

────────────────────────────────

11. Failure Modes & Recovery

Supported recovery types:

Soft Recovery
Auto-correction using Memory and Routing systems.

Hard Recovery
Restart Application Unit using Recovery System.

Full FallBack
Safe-mode minimal execution.

Total Abort
Escalate to Governance for violation logging.
