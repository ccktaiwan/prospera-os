1. Audit Scope

Scope: Governance Layer

Authority Source: SYSTEM_INDEX.md

Audit Method: Manual checklist verification against canonical index references

Audit Phase: A-9 (Governance Audit)

2. Canonical Governance Artifacts

The following governance artifacts are confirmed as canonical based on direct reference from SYSTEM_INDEX.md.

governance/GOVERNANCE.md

governance/PRINCIPLES.md

governance/ROLES.md

governance/SEMANTIC_BASELINE_v0.2.md

Status:

Canonical governance artifact set confirmed

No ambiguity detected in governance authority hierarchy

3. Non-Canonical or Reference Artifacts

The following classification applies to governance-related files or directories that exist under the governance/ directory but are not referenced by canonical governance artifacts.

Each entry is recorded with its current classification and required action.

File or Directory	Classification	Action Required
(to be filled)	Reference / Archive / Pending classification	None / Downgrade / Archive later

Note:

“Pending classification” is permitted when authority relevance cannot be determined during this audit phase.

No artifact is considered authoritative unless explicitly referenced by canonical governance artifacts.

4. Audit Conclusion

The governance layer authority is fully centralized under SYSTEM_INDEX.md.

No governance rules, constraints, or authority definitions exist outside the canonical governance artifacts referenced by the system index.

Any remaining actions identified during this audit are structural in nature and do not indicate conceptual or governance design deficiencies.

5. Next Phase Gate Decision
