Prospera OS
Recovery System Specification v1.2

Status: Stable
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: System Specification

Purpose
The Recovery System defines the structural rules, boundaries, and processes required for restoring Prospera OS from failure states, corruption events, drift incidents, or subsystem breakdowns.
Recovery ensures that the system can re-enter a valid, deterministic, and safe state.

Scope
2.1 Governs recovery triggers, recovery states, and restoration workflows.
2.2 Defines recovery schemas; Recovery Engine performs logic.
2.3 Modules may provide signals but may not initiate or execute recovery.
2.4 Recovery behavior must comply with Kernel v1.2 and Governance rules.

Recovery Principles
3.1 Recovery must be deterministic and reproducible.
3.2 Recovery may only restore validated and safe states.
3.3 Recovery must not introduce drift or version inconsistencies.
3.4 Recovery must preserve SSOT lineage.
3.5 Unauthorized recovery operations must be blocked.

Recovery Structure
Each recovery event must include:
4.1 Recovery Trigger
• drift, corruption, failure, inconsistency, or invalid state
4.2 Recovery Scope
• subsystem-level or system-wide
4.3 Recovery Plan
• deterministic sequence of operations
4.4 Restored State
• validated state post-recovery
4.5 Recovery Lineage
• record of all recovery decisions and evidence

Recovery Triggers
5.1 Memory corruption
5.2 Identity or intent drift
5.3 Execution failure
5.4 Safety escalation
5.5 Contract inconsistency
5.6 Version mismatch
5.7 Backtracking failure
5.8 Pipeline inconsistency
5.9 Governance directives

Recovery Operations
6.1 Diagnose
• classify type and severity of failure
6.2 Isolate
• quarantine affected components
6.3 Reconstruct
• rebuild correct state using lineage and evidence
6.4 Restore
• reintroduce validated components
6.5 Validate
• ensure system-wide consistency and safety

Recovery Constraints
7.1 No unsafe state may be restored (S3/S4 prohibited).
7.2 Recovery may not override Safety System decisions.
7.3 Recovery may not promote deprecated states.
7.4 Recovery must not alter Kernel-level structures.
7.5 All restored states must undergo integrity verification.

Subsystem Relationships
8.1 Backtracking System provides candidate historical states.
8.2 Memory System provides lineage for reconstruction.
8.3 Execution System coordinates recovery integration.
8.4 Modeling and Intent Systems must be revalidated after recovery.
8.5 Governance supervises and validates all recovery actions.

Integrity and Drift Rules
9.1 Recovered states must pass drift detection.
9.2 Recovery must remove corruption and inconsistent data.
9.3 Drift after recovery requires immediate remediation.
9.4 Recovery lineage must be complete and immutable.
9.5 Missing lineage invalidates recovery attempts.

Governance Enforcement
10.1 All recovery operations require Governance validation.
10.2 Executions must halt until recovery is complete.
10.3 Incorrect recovery attempts must be rejected.
10.4 Audit logs must store full recovery histories.
10.5 Version misalignment discovered during recovery must be corrected.

Version Alignment
11.1 Recovery System must align with Kernel v1.2.
11.2 Recovery Engine v1.2 required for all logic.
11.3 Deprecated recovery schemas must be blocked.
11.4 Migration from v1.1 requires rebuilding recovery plans.
11.5 Version mismatches must be remediated before restoration.
