Prospera OS
Memory System Specification v1.2

Status: Stable
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: System Specification

Purpose
The Memory System defines the rules, structures, and boundaries for storing, retrieving, validating, and managing all memory objects within Prospera OS.
The Memory System ensures deterministic behavior, lineage preservation, and strict compliance with Kernel architectural constraints.

Scope
2.1 Governs short-term, long-term, contextual, and structural memory.
2.2 Defines schemas and rules; Memory Engine implements logic.
2.3 Modules may provide signals but never modify memory.
2.4 All memory operations must comply with Kernel v1.2 and Governance validation.

Memory Principles
3.1 Memory must be deterministic and reproducible.
3.2 Memory may not store nondeterministic or heuristic-only content.
3.3 Memory must preserve lineage for all stored objects.
3.4 Unauthorized memory mutation is prohibited.
3.5 Memory integrity must be verifiable at all times.

Memory Structure
4.1 All memory objects must contain:
• Memory Type
• Identity Reference
• Context Window
• Persistency Class
• Lineage Reference
• Integrity Hash
4.2 Memory Type defines the class of memory (short-term, long-term, systemic).
4.3 Identity Reference binds memory to the Identity System.
4.4 Persistency Class determines reset, retention, or archival behavior.
4.5 Lineage ensures reconstruction and traceability.

Memory Classes
5.1 Short-Term Memory
• session-scoped and resettable
• must not persist beyond session unless promoted
5.2 Long-Term Memory
• persists across sessions
• requires Governance validation before update
5.3 Structural Memory
• OS-level persistent structures (schemas, system models)
• must align to Kernel SSOT
5.4 Execution Memory
• used during active execution cycles
• must be cleared after termination
5.5 Audit Memory
• immutable log references
• mandatory for Compliance and Governance

Memory Operations
6.1 Create
• requires authorized engine request
• must include lineage and integrity hash
6.2 Read
• must not modify memory
• must respect access boundaries
6.3 Update
• must include evidence and lineage delta
• requires Governance validation
6.4 Delete
• permitted only for short-term and execution memory
• prohibited for SSOT and audit memory
6.5 Promote
• upgrade short-term memory to long-term memory
• requires deterministic justification

Memory Constraints
7.1 No module or external signal may directly alter memory.
7.2 Memory must never conflict with SSOT lineage.
7.3 Memory drift must be immediately quarantined.
7.4 Memory must not store unsafe or nondeterministic states.
7.5 All memory must pass integrity verification.

Subsystem Relationships
8.1 Intent System consumes memory context but does not modify it.
8.2 Modeling System stores model lineage in memory.
8.3 Safety System uses memory as part of risk evaluation.
8.4 Execution System reads memory but may not persist it.
8.5 Pipeline System reads memory for routing consistency.

Governance Enforcement
9.1 All memory updates require validation.
9.2 Unauthorized memory mutation triggers execution halt.
9.3 Memory lineage must be verified for every execution cycle.
9.4 All memory operations must be recorded in audit logs.
9.5 Memory corruption requires immediate remediation.

Version Alignment
10.1 Memory formats must align with Kernel v1.2.
10.2 Deprecated memory structures must be migrated or blocked.
10.3 Memory Engine v1.2 is mandatory for all logic.
10.4 Version drift must trigger full memory revalidation.
10.5 Migration must rebuild lineage and integrity hashes.
