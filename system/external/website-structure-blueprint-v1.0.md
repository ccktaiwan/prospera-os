Prospera OS
Website Structure Blueprint v1.0

File: system/external/website-structure-blueprint-v1.0.md
Status: Draft
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: System Specification

This document defines the canonical website structure blueprint for
Prospera OS.

It specifies page hierarchy, ordering, and content boundaries for the
official Prospera OS website without introducing marketing claims,
application workflows, or system behavior changes.


Purpose

The purpose of this specification is to provide a deterministic,
governance-safe structure for the Prospera OS website.

The website serves as the primary external entry point and must preserve
Phase D boundaries and Phase E deliverable semantics.


Scope

This specification applies to:

- The official Prospera OS website
- Public-facing documentation portals
- Landing structures referenced by sales or partners

This document does not define copy, branding, design, or SEO strategy.


Website Structural Principles

All website content must adhere to the following principles:

- Governance context precedes system explanation
- No page may imply autonomous or decision-making behavior
- No page may expose kernel or enforcement internals
- Claims must align with the Commercial Boundary Pack
- Pages must reference Phase E artifacts

Any deviation constitutes a website governance violation.
