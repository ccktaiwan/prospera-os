Prospera OS
External Entry Map v0.1

File: system/external/external-entry-map-v0.1.md
Status: Draft
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: System Specification

This document defines the canonical external entry structure for Prospera OS.

It specifies how external audiences are permitted to discover, interpret,
and engage with Prospera OS without violating governance, authority,
or liability boundaries established in Phase D.


Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define a controlled, deterministic
entry map for external parties encountering Prospera OS.

This map ensures that all external understanding flows through approved
entry points and preserves the integrity of system governance semantics.


Scope

This specification applies to:

- Public repositories and documentation
- Whitepapers and technical overviews
- Sales, partnership, and consulting materials
- Demonstrations and educational content

This document does not introduce new system behavior.
It organizes external visibility only.


External Audience Classes

External audiences are classified into the following categories:

1. Technical Evaluators
2. Business Decision Makers
3. Governance and Compliance Reviewers
4. Implementation Partners
5. General Observers

Each class is granted access to different entry materials.


Canonical External Entry Points

The following artifacts constitute the only canonical external entry points
to Prospera OS.


Entry Point A: System Overview

Audience:
All external audiences

Artifact Types:
- README
- High-level architecture diagrams
- Conceptual system descriptions

Purpose:
To explain what Prospera OS is and what problem it addresses,
without exposing internal enforcement or implementation details.


Entry Point B: Governance and Boundary Explanation

Audience:
Business decision makers
Governance and compliance reviewers

Artifact Types:
- Governance overview documents
- Boundary and liability specifications
- Semantic baselines

Purpose:
To clarify authority, responsibility, and claim limitations.


Entry Point C: Technical Architecture Explanation

Audience:
Technical evaluators
Implementation partners

Artifact Types:
- System layer descriptions
- Engine and module relationship explanations
- Execution pipeline summaries

Purpose:
To demonstrate structural rigor without exposing enforcement internals.


Entry Point D: Application Scenarios

Audience:
Business decision makers
Consultants
Partners

Artifact Types:
- Use-case framing documents
- Scenario walkthroughs
- Controlled demonstrations

Purpose:
To contextualize system value without implying guarantees or autonomy.


Prohibited Entry Paths

The following entry paths are explicitly prohibited:

- Direct exposure of kernel enforcement logic
- Claims of autonomous intelligence or decision-making
- Presentation of modules as authoritative system definition
- Any representation conflicting with Phase D boundaries


Traversal Rules

External traversal must follow these rules:

- Entry must begin at a canonical entry point
- No external material may bypass governance context
- No artifact may imply authority beyond defined boundaries

Any deviation constitutes an external representation violation.


Relationship to Phase D

This document is subordinate to Phase D specifications.

In case of conflict, Phase D boundaries and liability definitions
take precedence over this entry map.
