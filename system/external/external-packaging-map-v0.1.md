Prospera OS
External Packaging Map v0.1

File: system/external/external-packaging-map-v0.1.md
Status: Draft
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: System Specification

This document defines the canonical external packaging structure for
Prospera OS.

It specifies how approved external artifacts are assembled, ordered,
and delivered to external audiences without modifying system behavior,
governance rules, or liability boundaries.


Purpose

The purpose of this specification is to translate Phase E external
deliverables into concrete, distributable packaging structures.

This map ensures that all external-facing materials are complete,
consistent, and compliant with governance and boundary constraints.


Scope

This specification applies to:

- Official websites and landing structures
- Whitepapers and technical overview documents
- Pitch decks and executive briefings
- Consulting and client onboarding kits

This document does not define messaging, copy, or branding.
It defines structure and ordering only.


Packaging Principles

All external packaging must adhere to the following principles:

- Packaging must not introduce new claims
- Packaging must not bypass governance context
- Packaging must preserve Phase D boundaries
- Packaging must reference Phase E artifacts

Any deviation constitutes a packaging violation.
