Prospera OS
Whitepaper Structure v1.0

File: system/external/whitepaper-structure-v1.0.md
Status: Draft
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: System Specification

This document defines the canonical structure for the Prospera OS
Whitepaper (Engineering Governance Edition).

It specifies section ordering, scope boundaries, and reference alignment.
It does not include narrative copy, marketing language, or guarantees.


Purpose

The purpose of this specification is to provide a deterministic structure
for producing a Prospera OS whitepaper that is technically rigorous,
governance-safe, and externally comprehensible.

This structure ensures consistency with Phase D and Phase E baselines.


Scope

This specification applies to the primary Prospera OS whitepaper intended
for technical evaluators, governance reviewers, and enterprise architects.

It does not define branding, design, or distribution strategy.


Whitepaper Audience Definition

Primary Audience:
- Technical evaluators
- Enterprise architects
- Governance and compliance reviewers

Secondary Audience:
- Executives seeking technical clarity
- Consultants and implementation partners


Whitepaper Structural Principles

The whitepaper must adhere to the following principles:

- No section may imply outcome guarantees
- No section may expose kernel or enforcement internals
- Governance context must precede execution descriptions
- Claims must align with Commercial Boundary Pack v0.1
- All sections must reference existing system artifacts

Any deviation requires governance review.
