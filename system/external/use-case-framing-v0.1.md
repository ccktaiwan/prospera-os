Prospera OS
Use-Case Framing Specification v0.1

File: system/external/use-case-framing-v0.1.md
Status: Draft
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: System Specification

This document defines the canonical use-case framing for Prospera OS.

Use-case framing describes contextual value alignment and system relevance
without defining applications, products, features, or implementation
details.


Purpose

The purpose of this specification is to present how Prospera OS may be
positioned across different organizational and professional contexts
while preserving governance, authority, and liability boundaries.

This document translates system capabilities into contextual relevance
without implying guarantees or autonomous behavior.


Scope

This specification applies to:

- Strategic positioning discussions
- Consulting and advisory framing
- Enterprise evaluation contexts
- Educational and explanatory materials

This document does not define products, applications, workflows,
or customer-specific implementations.


Framing Principles

All use-case framing must adhere to the following principles:

- Framing is descriptive, not prescriptive
- Framing does not imply outcomes or guarantees
- Framing does not expose enforcement internals
- Framing must comply with Phase D boundaries

Any framing violating these principles is prohibited.


Canonical Use-Case Frames

The following frames represent the only approved contextual
interpretations of Prospera OS.


Use-Case Frame A: Governance-First AI Oversight

Context:
Organizations operating AI-assisted workflows requiring
clear authority boundaries and auditability.

Framing:
Prospera OS may be framed as a governance-first system that
evaluates and constrains AI-assisted actions against
predefined authority and policy rules.

Value Emphasis:
- Reduced ambiguity in AI participation
- Improved traceability of decisions
- Clear separation of evaluation and execution


Use-Case Frame B: Enterprise Decision Governance Infrastructure

Context:
Enterprises managing complex decision pipelines across
human and automated actors.

Framing:
Prospera OS may be framed as an infrastructure layer that
governs whether actions may proceed, escalate, or halt
based on defined governance criteria.

Value Emphasis:
- Deterministic decision gating
- Governance consistency across systems
- Structural accountability without automation claims


Use-Case Frame C: Consulting and Advisory Enablement

Context:
Consultants and advisors supporting organizational
transformation, compliance, or AI adoption.

Framing:
Prospera OS may be framed as a system that supports
governance modeling, authority clarification, and
decision review structures.

Value Emphasis:
- Repeatable governance frameworks
- Clear responsibility allocation
- Reduced reliance on ad-hoc judgment


Use-Case Frame D: Engineering Governance Platform

Context:
Engineering teams building AI-assisted or automated systems
requiring strong governance guarantees.

Framing:
Prospera OS may be framed as a governance layer that
precedes execution systems and enforces constraints
before actions are performed.

Value Emphasis:
- Prevention of governance bypass
- Enforcement of non-delegable decisions
- Alignment between policy and execution


Prohibited Framing

The following framings are explicitly prohibited:

- Describing Prospera OS as an AI application
- Presenting Prospera OS as an autonomous system
- Claiming outcome optimization or correctness
- Framing Prospera OS as a replacement for human judgment

Any such framing constitutes a governance violation.


Relationship to Other Specifications

This document is subordinate to:

- External Entry Map v0.1
- External Claim & Liability Boundary Specification v0.1
- Governance Index and Semantic Baselines

In case of conflict, governance and liability specifications
take precedence.
