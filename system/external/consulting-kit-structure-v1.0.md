Prospera OS
Consulting Kit Structure v1.0

File: system/external/consulting-kit-structure-v1.0.md
Status: Draft
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: System Specification

This document defines the canonical structure for the Prospera OS
Consulting Kit.

The consulting kit operationalizes Prospera OS governance principles
into a repeatable, client-facing engagement structure without altering
system behavior, authority boundaries, or liability constraints.


Purpose

The purpose of this specification is to provide a deterministic,
governance-safe structure for consulting and advisory engagements
involving Prospera OS.

This structure ensures that every consulting interaction reinforces
system authority, governance clarity, and brand consistency.


Scope

This specification applies to:

- Consulting and advisory engagements
- Client onboarding and evaluation workshops
- Enterprise governance assessments
- Partner-led delivery programs

This document does not define consulting content or advice.
It defines engagement structure and boundaries only.


Consulting Structural Principles

All consulting engagements must adhere to the following principles:

- Governance context precedes solution discussion
- Authority and responsibility are explicitly clarified
- No outcome guarantees are implied
- Prospera OS is positioned as evaluation infrastructure, not a tool
- Engagement language must align with Commercial Boundary Pack v0.1

Any deviation constitutes a consulting governance violation.

Prohibited Consulting Practices

The following practices are explicitly prohibited:

- Bypassing governance orientation steps


Brand and Consistency Effect

By enforcing this consulting structure:

- Every engagement reinforces governance-first identity
- Brand perception emerges from system discipline
- Trust is built through consistency, not persuasion

This effect is an intentional outcome of the structure.


Validation and Review

All consulting engagements must be reviewed against:

- Phase D External Safety & Boundary Specifications

No engagement may proceed without alignment.
