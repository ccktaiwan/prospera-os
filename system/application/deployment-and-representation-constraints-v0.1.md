Prospera OS
Deployment & Representation Constraints v0.1

File: system/application/deployment-and-representation-constraints-v0.1.md
Status: Draft
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: System Specification

This document defines the mandatory constraints governing how Prospera OS
may be deployed, described, represented, or positioned in any internal,
external, technical, commercial, or public-facing context.


Purpose

The purpose of this document is to prevent semantic misrepresentation,
authority inflation, and capability overclaiming during the deployment
and communication of Prospera OS.

This specification ensures that Prospera OS is consistently represented
as a governance-first operating system, not as an autonomous agent,
decision-maker, or execution platform.

These constraints protect system integrity, user expectations, and
regulatory, legal, and ethical boundaries.


Scope

This specification applies to:

- Internal documentation
- External technical documentation
- Marketing or positioning materials
- Client-facing explanations
- Demonstrations and presentations
- Third-party references or integrations

This document does not define how Prospera OS is implemented.
It defines how Prospera OS may and may not be described.


Canonical Representation Principles

Prospera OS MUST be represented according to the following principles:

- Governance-first, not execution-first
- Authority-constraining, not authority-generating
- Deterministic enforcement, not autonomous decision-making
- Human-authority preserving, not human-replacing
- System-level governance, not application logic


Mandatory Deployment Constraints

1. Non-Autonomy Constraint

Prospera OS MUST NOT be described as autonomous.

It does not initiate actions, decisions, or execution independently.

All actions evaluated by Prospera OS originate from explicit human or
system requests.


2. Non-Decision Authority Constraint

Prospera OS MUST NOT be described as making decisions.

It evaluates requests against governance rules and authority definitions.

Final decisions always reside outside the system.


3. Non-Execution Constraint

Prospera OS MUST NOT be described as executing business operations,
engineering tasks, or organizational actions.

Execution occurs in external systems after governance clearance.


4. AI Capability Constraint

Prospera OS MUST NOT be described as an AI model, agent, or assistant.

It governs AI participation but does not replace or embody AI intelligence.


5. Intelligence Attribution Constraint

Prospera OS MUST NOT be described as intelligent, sentient, adaptive,
or self-learning.

All logic is deterministic and version-controlled.


Prohibited Representations

The following representations are explicitly prohibited:

- “Prospera OS makes decisions”
- “Prospera OS executes actions”
- “Prospera OS replaces human judgment”
- “Prospera OS is an autonomous AI system”
- “Prospera OS learns or adapts on its own”
- “Prospera OS guarantees correctness or outcomes”


Permitted Representations

The following representations are permitted:

- “Prospera OS governs whether actions may proceed”
- “Prospera OS enforces authority boundaries”
- “Prospera OS blocks or escalates violations”
- “Prospera OS provides governance guarantees”
- “Prospera OS constrains AI-assisted execution”


Deployment Boundary Conditions

Prospera OS may be deployed only in environments where:

- Human authority is explicitly defined
- Governance rules are versioned and auditable
- AI participation is constrained and reviewable
- Execution systems are external to Prospera OS

Any deployment violating these conditions is considered non-compliant.


Relationship to Other Specifications

This document relies on:

- Governance Index and Cross-Reference Map
- Kernel enforcement definitions
- Phase C semantic baselines
- Canonical Use-Case Blueprints v0.1

This document does not override governance or kernel authority.


Enforcement

Violation of these constraints constitutes a semantic violation.

Semantic violations must be treated as governance violations and may
trigger remediation, escalation, or withdrawal of deployment approval.
