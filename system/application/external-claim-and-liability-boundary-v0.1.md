File: system/application/external-claim-and-liability-boundary-v0.1.md
Status: Draft
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: System Specification

This document defines the external claim boundaries and liability
limitations governing the use, representation, and commercial or
contractual engagement of Prospera OS.


Purpose

The purpose of this specification is to clearly delimit what Prospera OS
may claim, guarantee, or represent to external parties, and where
responsibility and liability are explicitly excluded.

This document protects Prospera OS from over-claiming, misinterpretation,
and unintended assumption of legal, operational, or decision-making
responsibility.


Scope

This specification applies to:

- External clients and partners
- Commercial contracts and proposals
- Public documentation and whitepapers
- Demonstrations and pilot programs
- Regulatory, legal, or compliance discussions

This document does not define legal contracts.
It defines system-level claim and liability boundaries.


Claim Classification

External claims regarding Prospera OS are classified into three categories:

1. Permitted Claims
2. Restricted Claims
3. Prohibited Claims

Only permitted claims may be used without additional legal or governance
review.


Permitted Claims

The following claims are explicitly permitted:

- Prospera OS provides governance and authority enforcement mechanisms.
- Prospera OS evaluates actions against predefined governance rules.
- Prospera OS constrains AI-assisted execution according to policy.
- Prospera OS improves auditability and traceability of decisions.
- Prospera OS blocks, allows, or escalates requests based on rules.

These claims describe system behavior without implying guarantees.


Restricted Claims

The following claims require explicit qualification and context:

- Prospera OS improves decision quality.
- Prospera OS reduces operational risk.
- Prospera OS increases organizational reliability.
- Prospera OS enhances compliance readiness.

Restricted claims must be framed as potential or contextual outcomes,
not assured results.


Prohibited Claims

The following claims are strictly prohibited:

- Prospera OS guarantees correctness or compliance.
- Prospera OS ensures legal or regulatory approval.
- Prospera OS makes or replaces human decisions.
- Prospera OS eliminates risk or failure.
- Prospera OS acts autonomously or intelligently.

Any such claim constitutes a semantic and governance violation.


Liability Boundaries

Prospera OS explicitly disclaims liability for:

- Business outcomes
- Financial loss or gain
- Legal or regulatory decisions
- Human misuse or misconfiguration
- Actions executed outside the system

Prospera OS evaluates requests but does not execute or decide outcomes.


Responsibility Allocation

Responsibility is allocated as follows:

- Humans define governance rules and authority boundaries.
- Organizations approve deployment and usage context.
- Execution systems perform actions post-clearance.
- Prospera OS enforces governance logic only.

No responsibility is transferred to Prospera OS beyond governance
evaluation.


Third-Party Usage and Derivatives

Third parties may not:

- Rebrand Prospera OS as an autonomous system
- Embed Prospera OS to imply guarantees
- Use Prospera OS claims outside this specification
- Attribute independent intelligence to the system

Violations void any implied authorization.


Enforcement

Violations of this specification constitute external claim violations.

Such violations may result in:

- Withdrawal of usage permission
- Termination of pilot or partnership
- Public correction or clarification
- Legal or contractual remedies


Relationship to Other Specifications

This document relies on:

- Deployment & Representation Constraints v0.1
- Governance Index and Semantic Baselines
- Kernel and System authority definitions

In case of conflict, governance specifications take precedence.
