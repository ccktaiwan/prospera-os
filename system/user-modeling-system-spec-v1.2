Prospera OS
User Modeling System Specification v1.2

File: system/user-modeling-system-spec-v1.2
Status: Stable
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: System Specification

Purpose
The User Modeling System defines how Prospera OS constructs, maintains, interprets, and updates structured user representations.
User models enable deterministic personalization, execution routing, safety evaluation, and long-term system consistency across sessions.

Scope
2.1 The system governs user state, traits, preferences, behavior patterns, and model lineage.
2.2 The system defines schemas and boundaries, while the Modeling Engine performs actual logic.
2.3 Modules may contribute signals but may not modify the user model.
2.4 All behavior must comply with Kernel v1.2 boundaries and Governance validation.

Modeling Rules
3.1 All user models must be deterministic.
3.2 No stochastic or heuristic-only modeling is permitted.
3.3 User models must be reproducible across identical input conditions.
3.4 User models may not self-modify.
3.5 Unauthorized cross-layer access to user models is prohibited.

User Model Structure
4.1 Each user model consists of the following components:
• Identity Reference
• Stable Traits
• Session Variables
• Behavioral Signals
• Long-Term Preferences
• Safety Profile
• Lineage Metadata
4.2 Identity Reference links the model to the Identity System.
4.3 Stable Traits must remain consistent unless evidence supports modification.
4.4 Session Variables may reset per session but must be traceable.
4.5 Behavioral Signals must come from validated subsystem interactions.

User Model Constraints
5.1 No module may modify user models directly.
5.2 Engines must follow Modeling System rules and contract specifications.
5.3 User model data must not depend on nondeterministic platform behavior.
5.4 Conflicting model updates must trigger Governance review.
5.5 User models must be stored in SSOT-compliant structures.

Modeling Determination Rules
6.1 User model updates must be triggered only by authorized events.
6.2 All updates require evidence and lineage.
6.3 Behavioral change detection must be deterministic.
6.4 Invalid model states must be quarantined.
6.5 User model transitions must follow the Modeling State Machine v1.2.

Subsystem Relationships
7.1 User Modeling System owns the schema; Modeling Engine owns behavior.
7.2 Memory System stores model lineage and historical traces.
7.3 Safety System consumes user models for risk classification.
7.4 Intent System and Audience System read user models but do not modify them.
7.5 Pipeline System must reference but may not mutate the user model.

Governance Enforcement
8.1 Unauthorized model updates are blocked.
8.2 Model drift must be recorded and corrected.
8.3 Governance must validate all schema changes.
8.4 All model lineage must be auditable.
8.5 Missing or incompatible models must halt execution.

Version Alignment
9.1 User Modeling System must align with Kernel v1.2.
9.2 Deprecated model schemas must be rejected.
9.3 All model definitions must reference Modeling Engine v1.2.
9.4 Version drift must be remediated immediately.
9.5 Migration from v1.1 to v1.2 requires a complete lineage rebuild.
