Safety System Specification v1.2

Status: Stable
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: System Specification

Purpose
The Safety System defines the rules, structures, and boundaries required to ensure safe execution across all Prospera OS components.
This system governs safety classification, risk evaluation, constraint enforcement, and execution blocking mechanisms.

Scope
2.1 Governs risk classification, safety policies, constraint rules, and safety lineage.
2.2 Defines schemas and constraints; Safety Engine performs logic.
2.3 Modules may provide signals but may not evaluate or enforce safety.
2.4 All safety behavior must comply with Kernel v1.2 and Governance rules.

Safety Principles
3.1 Safety decisions must be deterministic.
3.2 Safety may not depend on nondeterministic platform behavior.
3.3 All safety decisions must be explainable and reproducible.
3.4 Safety must override execution and routing decisions.
3.5 Safety may not be disabled or bypassed by any subsystem.

Safety Structure
4.1 Each safety evaluation must include:
• Safety Class
• Policy Reference
• Evidence Reference
• Risk Score
• Lineage Identifier
4.2 Safety Class defines the risk category of a request or state.
4.3 Policy Reference indicates which safety rule is applied.
4.4 Evidence Reference links to audit evidence.
4.5 Lineage Identifier traces the decision path.

Safety Classes
5.1 Class S0 — No Risk
• fully safe, no restrictions
5.2 Class S1 — Low Risk
• may proceed with monitoring
5.3 Class S2 — Medium Risk
• requires additional validation
5.4 Class S3 — High Risk
• requires Governance approval
5.5 Class S4 — Block
• execution must be stopped immediately

Safety Operations
6.1 Evaluate
• must produce deterministic classification
• must reference safety policies
6.2 Enforce
• enforce constraints or blocking actions
• may override routing and execution
6.3 Monitor
• continuously track safety signals
• detect drift or escalation
6.4 Escalate
• elevated risks must be sent to Governance
6.5 Document
• all safety decisions must produce audit evidence

Safety Constraints
7.1 No module may perform safety evaluation.
7.2 Engines must not bypass safety enforcement.
7.3 System execution may not continue under S4 state.
7.4 Safety decisions must align with Safety Engine v1.2.
7.5 Safety drift must result in immediate quarantine.

Subsystem Relationships
8.1 Memory System stores safety lineage.
8.2 Modeling System provides user-related risk attributes.
8.3 Intent System mapping affects safety classification.
8.4 Execution System must enforce safety results.
8.5 Pipeline System may route based on safety class but may not modify it.

Governance Enforcement
9.1 Safety violations must halt execution.
9.2 Governance must validate all safety policies.
9.3 All safety updates must be version-aligned.
9.4 Drift or inconsistency must be corrected automatically.
9.5 Safety audit logs must remain immutable.

Version Alignment
10.1 Safety System must align with Kernel v1.2.
10.2 Safety policies incompatible with v1.2 must be migrated.
10.3 Deprecated safety schemas must be blocked.
10.4 All logic must reference Safety Engine v1.2.
10.5 Version drift requires full remediation.
