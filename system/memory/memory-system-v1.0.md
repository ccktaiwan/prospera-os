Prospera OS
Memory System Specification v1.0

Status: Stable
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: System Specification

────────────────────────────────

1. Purpose

The Memory System defines the structure, management, and access model for contextual, task-level, and system-level memory used throughout Prospera OS.

Its purpose is to ensure:

• deterministic memory behavior
• safe access and retrieval
• no cross-engine contamination
• consistent state across tasks
• alignment with SSOT
• strict governance and safety compliance

Memory System does not store user data in the traditional sense;
it maintains controlled execution context necessary for safe, predictable operation.

────────────────────────────────

2. Scope

The Memory System governs:

• contextual memory
• task memory
• ephemeral execution memory
• long-term OS state memory
• memory access rules
• memory lifecycle
• memory retrieval and decay
• memory scope and isolation
• integration with SSOT

The Memory System does not:

• store platform-specific data
• store raw user content
• store private or personal information
• perform reasoning
• execute logic

All memory operations are performed by the Memory Engine.

────────────────────────────────

3. System Principles

3.1 Deterministic Memory
Same inputs must produce same memory outcomes.

3.2 SSOT-Alignment
Memory is secondary; SSOT is primary.
Memory must not conflict with SSOT.

3.3 No Autonomous Mutation
Memory cannot modify itself.
Only Engine-controlled updates allowed.

3.4 Context Isolation
Memory from one task cannot leak into another.

3.5 Safety Priority
Memory must be sanitized before being used by Engines.

3.6 No Self-Expansion
Memory cannot grow outside defined memory contracts.

────────────────────────────────

4. Memory Types

The Memory System manages five distinct memory categories:

4.1 Ephemeral Memory

Short-lived, step-specific execution memory.
Cleared after pipeline completion.

4.2 Task Memory

Bound to an Application Unit.
Persists for the duration of a task.

4.3 Session Memory

Spans multiple tasks only when explicitly allowed by governance and safety.

4.4 System Memory

Internal OS contextual memory used for routing, error handling, and safety.

4.5 SSOT Memory Anchor

Reference to immutable canonical state.
Memory must always defer to SSOT.

────────────────────────────────

5. Memory Lifecycle

Memory follows a strict lifecycle:

Allocation
Generated by Memory Engine upon system or application request.

Initialization
Validated against safety and governance rules.

Usage
Read-only or read/write depending on memory type.

Decay
Ephemeral memory decays automatically.
Task memory decays upon completion.
Session memory decays upon termination.

Archival (Optional)
Memory snapshots stored as evidence.

Removal
Forced removal triggered by pipeline completion or governance order.

────────────────────────────────

6. System Interfaces
6.1 Input Interfaces

Memory System accepts requests from:

• Application System
• Execution System
• Backtracking System
• Recovery System
• Safety System

Memory System does not accept Module-level calls.

6.2 Output Interfaces

Memory System provides:

• memory-blocks
• memory context snapshot
• memory validity report
• memory→SSOT consistency check
• memory anchors for engines

────────────────────────────────

7. Memory Structure

Every memory object includes:

• memory-id
• memory-type
• allocation-source
• scope (ephemeral/task/session/system)
• read/write permissions
• safety flags
• governance flags
• expiration policy
• reference to SSOT version
• routing context
• audit-header

Memory objects must always be:

• structured
• typed
• deterministic
• non-ambiguous

────────────────────────────────

8. Access Control Model

Memory access is controlled by:

• Memory System (rules)
• Memory Engine (execution)
• Governance Layer (oversight)
• Safety System (permission checks)
• SSOT (canonical truth alignment)

8.1 Allowed Access

• Systems may request memory
• Engines may read/write memory via API
• Pipeline may serialize memory
• Governance may inspect memory

8.2 Forbidden Access

• Direct memory access by Modules
• Memory writes outside pipeline
• Cross-task memory merging
• Autonomous memory modification
• Memory override without governance approval

────────────────────────────────

9. Memory Safety Model

The Memory System enforces:

• conflict detection
• hallucination prevention
• drift detection
• unbounded growth prevention
• cross-engine contamination prevention
• privacy safety rules
• routing consistency safety

If safety fails:

• Memory is invalidated
• Pipeline freezes
• Violation Evidence generated
• Recovery or Backtracking triggered

────────────────────────────────

10. Memory Validation Checks

Every memory access must pass:

• SSOT parity check
• Intent consistency check
• Safety screening
• Version consistency check
• Drift detection
• Routing legality check

Failing any check prohibits memory usage.

────────────────────────────────

11. System Interaction Rules
11.1 Application System

Receives validated memory context for execution.

11.2 Execution System

Requires memory snapshots for determining flow.

11.3 Safety System

Uses memory as part of safety decision context.

11.4 Backtracking System

Uses memory to reconstruct prior states.

11.5 Recovery System

Uses memory for fallback or restoration.

────────────────────────────────

12. Prohibited Behaviors

Memory System may not:

• execute logic
• generate content
• modify SSOT
• modify Engine behavior
• store personal or platform-specific data
• create nondeterministic memory patterns
• merge contexts without authorization

────────────────────────────────

13. Error & Recovery Model

Memory errors classified:

Type A — Correctable

Minor corruption; Memory Engine rebuilds.

Type B — Major

Immediate invalidation; Recovery System takes over.

Type C — Critical

Governance Violation; task freeze.

Type D — Constitutional

SSOT mismatch; Kernel arbitration required.
