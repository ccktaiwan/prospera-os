Prospera OS
Intent System Specification v1.2

File: system/intent-system-spec-v1.2
Status: Stable
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: System Specification

Purpose
The Intent System defines how Prospera OS interprets, normalizes, classifies, and stabilizes intent across conversations, tasks, executions, and subsystems.
Intent determines what the user is asking, how the system should respond, and which downstream systems, engines, pipelines, and modules must be activated.

Scope
2.1 The Intent System governs intent classification and normalization.
2.2 The system defines intent models but does not implement classification logic (managed by the Intent Engine).
2.3 The Intent System does not interpret platform signals (Modules).
2.4 The system must comply fully with Kernel Boundary Specification v1.2.

Intent Rules
3.1 All incoming requests must map to exactly one canonical intent.
3.2 Intent must be deterministic and reproducible.
3.3 Intent classification must not rely on nondeterministic heuristic behavior.
3.4 Intent may not change unless triggered by authorized transitions.
3.5 Intent drift is prohibited and must be monitored by Governance.

Intent Structure
4.1 All intents consist of four fields:
• Intent Type
• Intent Scope
• Intent Context
• Intent Lineage
4.2 Intent Type represents the canonical intent category.
4.3 Intent Scope describes the operational domain the intent belongs to.
4.4 Intent Context contains structured semantic information.
4.5 Intent Lineage links the intent to the Identity System’s global identity chain.

Intent Determination
5.1 Intent must be determined before any execution begins.
5.2 No System, Engine, or Module may operate without a confirmed intent.
5.3 Conflicting intent signals must trigger Governance review.
5.4 Zero-intent or undefined-intent states must halt execution.
5.5 Updating intent during execution requires an authorized transition rule.

Intent State Rules
6.1 Intent must remain stable unless a transition is formally invoked.
6.2 Intent transitions must be deterministic.
6.3 Invalid state transitions must be blocked by the Intent Engine.
6.4 All state transitions must be logged as evidence.
6.5 State definitions must comply with Intent State Machine v1.2.

Intent–System Relationships
7.1 Intent System owns intent normalization; Engine performs logic.
7.2 Pipeline System may only consume intent, not modify it.
7.3 Modules may only provide raw signals to be normalized.
7.4 Governance may override or halt intent processing.
7.5 Autonomy System may request reclassification with Governance approval.

Intent Enforcement
8.1 Intent must be validated by Governance before execution.
8.2 Intent conflicts must be quarantined.
8.3 Drift between user instructions and intent classification must be recorded.
8.4 Unauthorized sources may not mutate intent.
8.5 All errors must halt execution until resolved.

Version Alignment
9.1 The Intent System must align with Kernel v1.2.
9.2 Intent formats incompatible with v1.2 must be migrated.
9.3 Deprecated intent schemas must be blocked.
9.4 Intent Engine v1.2 must be used for all logic.
9.5 Version mismatches must trigger remediation.
