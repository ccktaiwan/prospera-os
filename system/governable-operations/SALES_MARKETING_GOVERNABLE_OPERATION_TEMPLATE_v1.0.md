Purpose

This document defines a standardized governable operation template
for Sales and Marketing activities executed under Prospera OS.

Its purpose is to demonstrate how high-frequency, AI-assisted,
externally facing operations can be executed without delegating
decision authority to AI systems.

This template is designed for replication across organizations
claiming compliance with Prospera OS governance.

Applicable Scenarios

This template applies to operations involving:

AI-generated marketing or sales content

Audience targeting and segmentation

Use of existing customer or prospect data

External publication, advertising, or customer communication

Governable Decision Chain Application

is applied to Sales & Marketing operations.

Step 1 — Intent Declaration

Allowed:

Explicit business or marketing intent declared by a human role

Prohibited:

AI-originated intent

Governance Requirement:

Intent must be classified as an external-facing operation

Enforcement:

Intent Engine

Governance intent classification rules

Step 2 — Context Validation

Required Context:

Industry classification

Publication channel

Regulatory sensitivity (e.g., healthcare, finance)

Governance Requirement:

Missing mandatory context blocks progression

Enforcement:

Modeling / Context validation

Kernel precondition checks

Step 3 — Policy Evaluation

Policy Domains:

Advertising regulations

Data usage and privacy policy

Brand and tone restrictions

Governance Requirement:

Policy violations downgrade AI role to draft-only

Enforcement:

Safety / Policy evaluation engine

Governance policy sets

Step 4 — Risk & Impact Assessment

Risk Dimensions:

Legal exposure

Brand reputation

Customer trust

Governance Requirement:

High-risk outcomes require escalation

Enforcement:

Risk modeling

Kernel escalation thresholds

Step 5 — Authorization

Authorization Rules:

Must be performed by a designated human authority

AI systems are explicitly excluded

Governance Requirement:

No authorization, no execution

Enforcement:

Kernel authorization gate

Role-based approval verification

Step 6 — Execution

Execution Characteristics:

AI may generate content or recommendations

Humans approve and initiate publication

Governance Requirement:

Execution must match authorized scope

Enforcement:

Execution engine

System audit logging

Step 7 — Recovery & Audit

Recovery Actions:

Content withdrawal

Correction or clarification

Audience notification if required

Audit Requirements:

Full traceability of intent, approval, and execution

Enforcement:

Governance Invariants

AI systems do not make final decisions

No step in the decision chain may be skipped

Execution is always attributable to a human authority

All actions are auditable and reversible where possible

Usage Guidance

This template may be adapted for:

Different industries

Different regulatory environments

Different organizational structures

However, adaptations must not modify the underlying decision chain
or governance authority definitions.
