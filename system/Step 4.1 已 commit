Prospera OS — System Inventory v0.1

This document defines the authoritative inventory of the Prospera OS system.

It enumerates repositories, core layers, execution engines, and governance artifacts that collectively constitute the Prospera OS architecture.

This inventory serves as a system existence ledger for auditing, claim validation, and engineering alignment.

---

1. Repositories

The Prospera ecosystem is currently composed of the following repositories:

1. prospera-os
Role:
- Canonical governance authority
- Execution constraints
- Enforcement, versioning, and semantic baselines

Status:
- Active
- Governance semantic baseline v0.2 established

2. ai-governed-software-engineering
Role:
- Engineering whitepaper
- Reference implementation patterns
- Non-authoritative explanatory layer

Status:
- Active
- Subordinate to prospera-os governance

3. prospera-intelligence
Role:
- Conceptual, cognitive, and ethical foundation
- Human-centric intelligence framing

Status:
- Active
- Non-governing, non-executing

2. Core System Layers (Five-Layer Model)

Layer 1: Governance Kernel
- Location: prospera-os/governance/
- Function:
  - Authority definition
  - Non-overridable constraints
  - Semantic baseline enforcement

Layer 2: Decision and Permission Layer
- Location: prospera-os/engine/, prospera-os/contract/
- Function:
  - Action classification
  - Permission evaluation
  - Escalation routing

Layer 3: Execution Layer
- Location: prospera-os/engine/
- Function:
  - Human and AI execution under governance constraints

Layer 4: Validation and Audit Layer
- Location: prospera-os/governance/validation protocols
- Function:
  - Compliance verification
  - Traceability
  - Incident review

Layer 5: Evolution and Versioning Layer
- Location: prospera-os/governance/versioning
- Function:
  - Controlled evolution
  - Semantic version locking
  - Governance updates

---

3. Execution Engines (Identified)

The system currently defines the following execution engines or engine classes:

- Action Evaluation Engine
- Governance Enforcement Engine
- Escalation and Resolution Engine
- Version Control and Semantic Lock Engine

Each engine may be implemented incrementally and is governed by the canonical governance layer.

---

4. Module Count and Scope

The Prospera OS system includes:

- 40+ governance, protocol, and enforcement modules
- Multiple execution pathways
- Explicit role separation between human and AI actors

This modular structure enables partial implementation without architectural degradation.

---

5. System Status Summary

- Architecture: Defined
- Governance: Canonical and enforced
- Execution: Partially implemented
- Auditability: Enabled
- Evolution: Controlled

Prospera OS qualifies as a governance-first executable system architecture.
