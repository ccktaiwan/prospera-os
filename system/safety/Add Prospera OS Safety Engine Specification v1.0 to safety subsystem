Prospera OS Drift Detection Specification v1.0
File: system/safety/drift-detection-spec-v1.0.md
Status: Stable
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: Safety Subsystem Specification
1. Purpose

This document defines the Drift Detection Engine, the subsystem responsible for identifying, reporting, and escalating all forms of drift across the Prospera OS.
Drift is one of the most dangerous failure modes in generative systems.
The Drift Detection Engine ensures the OS remains:

aligned

predictable

consistent

role-bound

intent-bound

identity-safe

non-divergent

Drift detection is mandatory for every task, every output, and every routing action.

2. What is Drift?

“Drift” refers to any deviation away from the correct state, including:

2.1 Semantic Drift

Meaning changes, topic deviation, unintended inference.

2.2 Intent Drift

Shift away from the declared user task or system goal.

2.3 Identity Drift

Change in voice, role, persona, or system identity.

2.4 Task Drift

Shifting tasks without request, mixing tasks, or incorrect continuation.

2.5 Routing Drift

Transitioning to an incorrect engine, module, or layer.

2.6 Version Drift

Mismatched document or memory versioning.

2.7 SSOT Drift

Divergence from canonical ground truth.

Any drift is a risk event.

3. Drift Detection Engine Role

The Drift Detection Engine performs six duties:

Monitor
Observe all system operations in real time.

Analyze
Compare behavior against expected patterns.

Score
Assign drift severity values.

Classify
Tag drifts into defined categories.

Block or Warn
Prevent unsafe continuation.

Escalate
Notify Safety Engine or Governance when required.

4. Drift Detection Pipeline

Every operation passes through the drift pipeline:
1. Context Construction  
2. Baseline Establishment  
3. Real-Time Comparison  
4. Drift Scoring  
5. Drift Classification  
6. Drift Verdict  
7. Routing to Safety Engine
No operation can bypass drift detection.

5. Drift Detection Inputs

The engine receives:

identity state

intent state

role constraints

routing request

generation output

memory read/write request

SSOT version hash

template structure

task metadata

6. Drift Detection Outputs

The engine outputs:

Drift Score (0–100)

Drift Category

Severity Level

Corrective Suggestion

Safety Engine Request

Governance Escalation Packet

Audit Log Entry

7. Drift Scoring Model

Drift severity is calculated from:

deviation magnitude

deviation direction

impact on safety

impact on routing

impact on identity/intent

structural deviation

semantic deviation

temporal mismatch

SSOT divergence

Scoring Scale:
| Score  | Meaning           |
| ------ | ----------------- |
| 0–10   | No drift          |
| 11–20  | Minor drift       |
| 21–40  | Moderate drift    |
| 41–60  | Significant drift |
| 61–80  | Severe drift      |
| 81–100 | Critical drift    |
8. Drift Classes

Same as Safety Engine error classes, but drift-focused:

Class A — Minor

Small divergences, autocorrectable.

Class B — Moderate

Non-critical but must block continuation.

Class C — Severe

Dangerous deviation requiring Recovery Engine.

Class D — Critical

Identity/Intent drift requiring Governance L4.

Class E — Catastrophic

SSOT deviation or existential risk → Governance L5 lockdown.

9. Drift Enforcement Rules

The Drift Detection Engine MUST enforce:

No output allowed with Class C–E drift.

All Class B drift must be corrected before continuation.

Class A drift must be normalized immediately.

Identity and Intent drift automatically promote to Class D.

SSOT drift automatically promotes to Class E.

Cross-task drift triggers rollback.

Routing drift requires re-validation and correction.

Memory drift triggers isolation until resolved.

10. Drift Baseline Computation

The engine constructs baselines using:

identity constraints

intent objectives

template boundaries

routing map

memory-state hash

SSOT version

Baseline → expected behavior
Output → actual behavior

Drift = actual - baseline

11. Subsystem Interactions
11.1 With Safety Engine

Primary downstream consumer.
Drift → Safety.

11.2 With Template Engine

Detects template drift (order, structure, density).

11.3 With Generation Engine

Detects hallucination and semantic drift.

11.4 With Identity System

Detects persona/role drift.

11.5 With Intent System

Detects goal/task drift.

11.6 With Memory System

Detects memory inconsistency or contamination.

11.7 With Routing Validator

Detects illegal transitions.

11.8 With SSOT

Verifies version and canonical alignment.

12. Drift Blocking Mechanisms

When drift is detected:

Freeze operation

Request Safety Engine decision

If allowed: autocorrect

If blocked: rollback

If severe: Recovery Engine

If critical: Governance escalation

13. Logging Requirements

Drift logs MUST include:

drift category

drift score

baseline hash

actual output hash

subsystem involved

routing context

memory context

severity class

corrective action

timestamp

SSOT reference

All logs → SSOT.
