Prospera OS
Identity System Specification v1.2

File: system/identity-system-spec-v1.2
Status: Stable
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: System Specification

Purpose
The Identity System defines the unified identity model for all Prospera OS components, conversations, tasks, executions, pipelines, and system contexts.
Identity ensures that every request, subsystem, engine, and module is uniquely identifiable and traceable across deterministic execution flows.

Scope
2.1 This specification governs identity assignment for:
• conversations
• tasks
• subsystems
• engines
• modules
• pipelines
• sessions
• user roles
• OS internal processes
2.2 This system defines identity structures but does not implement behavior (Engine layer responsibility).
2.3 Identity rules must follow Kernel Boundary Specification v1.2.

Identity Rules
3.1 All entities must possess a globally unique identity.
3.2 Identity must be deterministic and reproducible.
3.3 Identity may not depend on platform randomness.
3.4 Identity generation logic must be implemented only in the Identity Engine.
3.5 Identity must not drift during a session or execution.
3.6 Identity mutation is prohibited except through authorized transitions.

Identity Structure
4.1 All identities consist of four components:
• Type
• Scope
• Version
• Lineage
4.2 Type defines the OS entity class (system, engine, module, task, etc.).
4.3 Scope defines global, session, task, or subsystem context.
4.4 Version maps identity to the OS version lineage.
4.5 Lineage records the origin chain for determinism and traceability.

Identity Constraints
5.1 No two identities may be identical within the same scope.
5.2 Identity collisions require immediate quarantine.
5.3 Identity must remain stable across drift events.
5.4 Identity must be compatible with SSOT lineage.
5.5 Identity must not include nondeterministic entropy.

Identity Relationships
6.1 Parent–child identity relationships must follow deterministic rules.
6.2 Systems own Engines; Engines do not own Systems.
6.3 Modules may not own Systems or Engines.
6.4 Pipelines may not modify identity; they may only reference it.
6.5 Audience System may read but not modify identity.

Identity Enforcement
7.1 All identity assignment must be validated by Governance.
7.2 Only the Identity Engine may generate new identities.
7.3 Unauthorized identity creation must be blocked.
7.4 Identity drift must be recorded as evidence.
7.5 All identity state must be reviewable through audit logs.

Version Alignment
8.1 Identity System must align to Kernel v1.2.
8.2 Identity formats incompatible with v1.2 must be migrated.
8.3 Deprecated identity formats must be blocked.
8.4 All identity schemas must reference Identity Engine v1.2.
8.5 Version mismatches require immediate remediation.
