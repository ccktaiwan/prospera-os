Type: Codex Operation Log (Post-hoc Documentation)
Scope: System Architecture & Governance Alignment

Summary:
This log documents the actual discussions and alignment activities that took place on 2025-12-19,
prior to full Codex operationalization within the GitHub repository.
No direct operational commits were performed on this date.
This entry is added post-hoc to preserve factual system memory and governance integrity.

Actions & Discussions:
- Conducted a full-system discussion on External Information Engines,
  including identification of external data sources, signal intake boundaries,
  and trust / alignment constraints.
- Conducted a structured discussion on Internal Information Engines,
  clarifying internal knowledge layers, decision logic boundaries,
  and governance-relevant information scopes.
- Explored the integration of external and internal information engines
  through a dual-track generative approach,
  ensuring generation-time alignment rather than post-generation correction.
- Explicitly discussed alignment credentials and authorization boundaries,
  defining which modules may generate, which require human-in-the-loop approval,
  and which outputs are considered valid under governance rules.
- Mapped Internal Information Engines against enterprise internal control concepts,
  referencing the eight major internal control processes.
- Clarified that enterprises do not require all eight control processes at inception.
  Adoption must be staged.
- Introduced McKinsey’s four stages of enterprise growth as a calibration framework,
  aligning enterprise maturity stages with progressive activation of internal control processes.
- Established that Internal Information Engines must support real operational scenarios,
  scaling with enterprise maturity rather than existing as a static, fully-loaded system.

Irreversibility Assessment:
- No irreversible engineering actions were executed on this date.
- No Codex files were committed to the repository on 2025-12-19.
- All activities remained at the alignment, design, and governance-discussion level.

Governance Notes:
- This log exists to preserve system truth and prevent historical ambiguity.
- It explicitly distinguishes between discussion-based alignment
  and repository-level operational commits.
- Codex operational commits began on subsequent dates.

Status:
- Valid Codex operation log
- Non-declarative
- Non-release
- Non-milestone
