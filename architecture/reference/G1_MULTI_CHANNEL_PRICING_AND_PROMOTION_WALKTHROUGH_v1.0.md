Purpose

This document demonstrates how a multi-channel pricing and sales promotion process is governed end-to-end using the Prospera Governable Decision Chain.

The example covers coordinated pricing decisions across multiple sales and marketing channels, where financial, legal, brand, and fairness risks coexist.

This document is illustrative and does not define governance authority.

Process Overview

Enterprise Process: Multi-Channel Pricing & Sales Promotion

Typical characteristics:

Multiple distribution channels (direct sales, partners, online platforms)

Price differentiation and discount strategies

Sales enablement and marketing support coordination

Revenue, margin, and compliance exposure

High risk of inconsistency and unfair pricing

AI-assisted pricing or promotion recommendations

This process is governance-critical due to its systemic impact.

Decision Chain Walkthrough
Step 1 — Intent Declaration

Declared Intent:

Launch coordinated sales promotion

Apply differentiated pricing across channels

Support frontline sales with promotional assets

Achieve revenue or volume targets

Engine Involved:

Intent Engine

Input Artifacts:

Promotion objective

Channel list and scope

Pricing strategy (baseline, discount ranges)

Time window for promotion

Governance Notes:

Intent must explicitly state pricing differentiation logic

“Flexible pricing” without bounds is invalid

Blocking Conditions:

Undefined pricing boundaries

Undefined channel scope

Missing promotion duration

Step 2 — Context Validation

Context Evaluated:

Existing channel agreements

Contractual pricing constraints

Historical promotion conflicts

Customer segment overlap

Regulatory constraints (e.g., price discrimination rules)

Engines Involved:

Modeling Engine

Memory Engine

Kernel Enforcement:

Contract and agreement boundaries

Channel conflict detection

Jurisdictional constraints

Blocking Conditions:

Conflict with partner contracts

Overlapping promotions causing unfair advantage

Missing jurisdictional data

Step 3 — Policy Evaluation

Policies Applied:

Internal pricing governance policy

Channel fairness rules

Competition and antitrust guidelines

Sales authorization policies

Engine Involved:

Safety Engine

Output:

Policy compliance verdict

Identified policy conflicts or constraints

Blocking Conditions:

Unjustified channel price disparity

Violation of internal discount limits

Regulatory risk flags

Step 4 — Risk Assessment

Risks Assessed:

Margin erosion risk

Channel conflict escalation risk

Legal and regulatory exposure

Brand trust and customer perception risk

AI-generated pricing recommendation risk

Engines Involved:

Safety Engine

Backtracking Engine

Risk Outputs:

Risk classification

Escalation recommendation

Blocking Conditions:

High regulatory exposure

Unexplained AI-driven price variance

Margin risk beyond governance threshold

Step 5 — Human Governance Authorization (F-4)

Trigger Reason:

Financial impact across channels

External partner and customer exposure

Risk of unfair pricing perception

Governance Actors:

Sales leadership

Pricing or finance owner

Legal or compliance reviewer (if required)

Authorization Requirements:

Explicit approval of pricing ranges per channel

Acknowledgment of identified risks

Acceptance of financial and reputational responsibility

Defined validity window for promotion

Kernel Enforcement:

Authorization must match this Decision Chain instance

Authorization scope strictly enforced

Expired or revoked authorization blocks execution

Step 6 — Governed Execution

Execution Actions:

Pricing configuration per channel

Promotion asset deployment

Sales enablement material distribution

System and platform updates

Engines Involved:

Execution Engine

Pipeline Engine

System Controls:

Channel-specific price caps

Promotion timing enforcement

Configuration consistency checks

Blocking Conditions:

Execution outside approved pricing range

Channel misconfiguration

Unauthorized discount application

Step 7 — Recovery and Audit

Post-Execution Activities:

Pricing consistency audit

Sales performance and margin tracking

Channel dispute monitoring

Incident response if conflicts arise

Engines Involved:

Recovery Engine

Memory Engine

Audit Artifacts:

Authorization records

Execution logs

Pricing change history

Policy evaluation results

Governance Outcome:

Full traceability from pricing intent to execution

Clear accountability for pricing decisions

Evidence for audit, partner review, and dispute resolution

Key Governance Demonstration Points

This walkthrough demonstrates that:

Multi-channel pricing cannot be fragmented or ad-hoc

AI-assisted pricing never self-authorizes

Human authorization is mandatory for financial exposure

Execution is bounded by Kernel enforcement

Accountability and fairness are preserved across channels

Canonical Relationship

This document is non-canonical.

Authoritative governance definitions remain in the Governance Layer.

This walkthrough exists to demonstrate feasibility and governance correctness.
