Purpose

This document defines the official Governance Case Library for Prospera OS.

The case library provides concrete, end-to-end demonstrations showing how enterprise processes are governed using the Prospera Governable Decision Chain.

It exists to prove governance feasibility, auditability, and correctness across real operational scenarios.

This document does not define governance rules.

Role of the Case Library

The Governance Case Library serves three functions:

Demonstrate that governance rules are executable, not theoretical

Provide reference patterns for enterprise teams and AI-assisted workflows

Supply auditable evidence for compliance, risk, and oversight stakeholders

Governance Coverage Matrix (Summary)

The current case library demonstrates governance across:

Financial exposure

Customer data and privacy

AI-assisted decision making

Human authorization and accountability

Kernel-enforced execution

Full audit and recovery

Extension Policy

New governance cases may be added when:

A real enterprise process is fully mapped to the seven-step decision chain

Blocking and escalation points are explicitly defined

Human accountability is clearly assigned

Execution and auditability are demonstrated

All cases must reference canonical governance and decision chain definitions.

Canonical Relationship

This document is non-canonical.

Authoritative governance definitions remain in the Governance Layer.

The Case Library exists to demonstrate governance correctness, not to define authority.
