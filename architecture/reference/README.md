Prospera OS — Architecture Reference Layer

Status: Reference
Authority: Non-Canonical
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Scope: Architecture Support Materials

Purpose

This directory contains non-authoritative architectural reference materials used to support understanding, implementation guidance, and system interpretation of Prospera OS.

All contents in this directory are explicitly classified as Reference.
They do not define governance authority, kernel constraints, or system truth.

Interpretation Rules

- Documents in this directory may explain, illustrate, or contextualize canonical system behavior.
- Documents in this directory MUST NOT introduce new rules, constraints, or authoritative definitions.
- In the event of conflict, Governance and Kernel layers always take precedence.

Relationship to Canonical Layers

This directory exists to support, not define:

- Governance Layer (authoritative)
- Kernel Layer (non-overridable)
- System Layer (audit and validation)

Absence of a document here does not imply absence of system capability.

Canonical definitions are declared elsewhere.
