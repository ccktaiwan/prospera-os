# Prospera OS — Claim-to-System Traceability Table

Status: Canonical (IP Traceability Specification)
Version: v1.0
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Scope: Claim-to-System Responsibility Mapping
Authority: SYSTEM_INDEX (SSOT)

---

## 1. Purpose

This document provides a deterministic traceability mapping between
the Prospera OS Patent Family Claim Tree and the concrete system
architecture, governance stages, and enforcement mechanisms.

Its purpose is to demonstrate that all patent claims are:

- Engineering-grounded
- Implementable
- Enforceable
- Auditable
- Non-abstract

This document is authoritative for patent examination, due diligence,
and internal governance validation.

---

## 2. Traceability Principles

All claims MUST satisfy the following:

1. Each claim maps to at least one concrete system component.
2. Each claim maps to at least one governance stage or enforcement gate.
3. Claims asserting prevention or restriction map to enforcement logic.
4. Claims asserting determinism map to replay or verification mechanisms.
5. Claims asserting human authority map to explicit HITL specifications.

## 3. Root Claim Traceability

### Root Claim A — Governance-First Execution Operating System

| Claim Element | System Component | Governance Stage | Enforcement / Gate |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Input boundary governance | Input Boundary Governance Layer | Pre-Stage | Semantic Contract Binding |
| Stage-based pipeline | STAGE_01–05 | Stage 01–05 | Non-bypassable ordering |
| Deterministic arbitration | SYSTEM_COORDINATES | Stage 03 | Execution Binding |
| Enforcement binding | Enforcement Adapters | Stage 04 / 05 | Failure-closed control |
| Human authority | HITL Authority Spec | Stage 03–05 | Escalation lock |
| Deterministic replay | CI / Replay Gate | Orthogonal | Replay verification |

---

## 4. Primary Branch Traceability

### Branch B — Input Boundary Semantic Preservation

| Claim Aspect | System Anchor | Enforcement Mechanism |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| Language / script detection | Input Boundary Layer | Admission rejection |
| Prohibition of translation | Semantic Contract | Escalation / DENY |
| Semantic immutability | Semantic Contract Spec | Enforcement Adapter |

---

### Branch C — Stage-Based Governance Pipeline

| Claim Aspect | System Anchor | Enforcement Mechanism |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| Fixed stage order | STAGE_01–05 | Pipeline gate |
| No out-of-stage execution | Execution Binding | DENY |
| Authority separation | SYSTEM_INDEX | Structural invariant |

---

### Branch D — Deterministic Arbitration Coordinates

| Claim Aspect | System Anchor | Enforcement Mechanism |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| Coordinate arbitration | SYSTEM_COORDINATES | Pre-execution gate |
| Deterministic outcome | Replay Runner | CI / Replay |
| No heuristic override | Enforcement Spec | Failure-closed |

---

### Branch E — Enforcement Adapter Binding

| Claim Aspect | System Anchor | Enforcement Mechanism |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| ALLOW / DENY / ESCALATE | Enforcement Adapter | Execution gate |
| No silent fallback | Adapter Spec | Hard fail |
| Binding to execution | Stage 04 | Execution lock |

---

### Branch F — Human-in-the-Loop Authority

| Claim Aspect | System Anchor | Enforcement Mechanism |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| Non-delegable decisions | HITL Authority Spec | Escalation lock |
| No AI inference | Governance Rules | Prohibited behavior |
| Human resolution logging | Audit / Replay | Immutable record |

---

### Branch G — CI / Replay Verification

| Claim Aspect | System Anchor | Enforcement Mechanism |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| Deterministic replay | Replay Runner | CI gate |
| Verification before release | CI Pipeline | Merge block |
| Audit evidence | Audit Artifacts | Immutable logs |

---

## 5. Examiner & Due Diligence Notes

- No claim relies on abstract governance concepts alone.
- All claims correspond to concrete system responsibilities.
- All prohibitions are enforced through explicit system gates.
- All determinism claims are verifiable via replay.
- All human authority claims are explicitly non-automatable.

---

## 6. Authority Statement

This table is the authoritative bridge between Prospera OS system
architecture and patent claims.

Any claim not traceable through this table is considered unsupported
and non-canonical.
