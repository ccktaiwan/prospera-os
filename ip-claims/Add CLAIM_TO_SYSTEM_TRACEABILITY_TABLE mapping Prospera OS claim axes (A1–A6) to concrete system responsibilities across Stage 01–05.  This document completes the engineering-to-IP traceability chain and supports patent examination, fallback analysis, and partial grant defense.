# Prospera OS — Examiner Walkthrough (Engineering-Grounded)

Status: Canonical (Examination Support Artifact)
Version: v1.0
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Scope: Examiner-Guided System Interpretation
Authority: SYSTEM_INDEX (SSOT)

## 1. Purpose

This document provides a structured walkthrough of Prospera OS for patent
examiners.

Its sole purpose is to enable accurate interpretation of claims by
anchoring them to concrete system behavior and stage-based responsibilities.

This document introduces no new system behavior and no new claim scope.

## 2. How to Read Prospera OS

Prospera OS is a stage-based execution operating system.

Claims are not abstract rules; they are grounded in mandatory system stages
that execute sequentially and cannot be bypassed.

Examination should proceed in stage order.

## 3. Stage-by-Stage Walkthrough

### Stage 01 — System Boundary Definition
What happens:
- Invocation context is validated.
- Non-governed invocations are rejected.

Why it matters:
- Establishes a governed execution domain.
- Prevents unauthorized execution paths.

Claims grounded here:
- Deterministic recording of boundary decisions.

---

### Stage 02 — Governance Formalization
What happens:
- Governance constitution is bound to invocation.
- Authority and escalation rules are fixed.

Why it matters:
- Ensures downstream decisions are not subjective.
- Locks policy before evaluation.

Claims grounded here:
- Deterministic governance context binding.

---

### Stage 03 — Invocation Validation
What happens:
- Requested execution and generation capabilities are evaluated.
- Permission is determined before any state change.

Why it matters:
- Prevents irreversible errors.
- Separates decision from execution.

Claims grounded here:
- Pre-execution arbitration.
- Execution vs. generation separation.
- Capability bounding.

---

### Stage 04 — Execution Binding
What happens:
- Permission outcomes are bound to execution.
- Non-bypassable enforcement gates execution.

Why it matters:
- Ensures decisions are actually enforced.
- Prevents escalation or bypass.

Claims grounded here:
- Enforcement adapter.
- Capability degradation under accumulated risk.

---

### Stage 05 — Generation Surface
What happens:
- Outputs and artifacts are emitted.
- Feedback and audit signals are captured.

Why it matters:
- Enables replay and verification.
- Feeds future risk assessment.

Claims grounded here:
- Deterministic replay and audit.

## 4. Key Examination Clarifications

- AI components do not make decisions.
- All permission decisions are system-governed.
- Determinism is structural, not statistical.
- Claims describe system control mechanisms, not business policy.

## 5. Examination Guidance

When evaluating novelty and eligibility:
- Assess technical control effects.
- Assess determinism and enforcement.
- Assess prevention of irreversible execution.

Avoid interpreting claims as abstract governance rules.
