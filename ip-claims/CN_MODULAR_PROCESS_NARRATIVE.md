## Technical Field
Enterprise computer systems for governed execution and generation control
in AI-assisted workflows.

## Technical Problem
Existing systems lack clear modular control over AI execution, resulting in
uncontrolled automation and untraceable errors.

## Technical Solution
A modular system comprising:
- Governance arbitration module
- Coordinate evaluation module
- Capability degradation module
- Enforcement adapter module
- Replay and audit module

## Process Flow
1. Receive invocation request
2. Perform arbitration based on stage and coordinates
3. Determine permission result
4. Apply capability degradation if risk accumulates
5. Enforce execution or block generation
6. Record results for replay

## Technical Effect
- Clear module boundaries
- Deterministic execution control
- Improved safety and auditability
