# Prospera OS — Patent Family Claim Tree (Engineering Codex)

Status: Canonical (Engineering Claim Specification)
Version: v1.0
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Scope: Patent Family Architecture and Claim Ground Truth
Authority: SYSTEM_INDEX (SSOT)

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the canonical Patent Family Claim Tree for Prospera OS.

It serves as the engineering ground truth from which all legal patent
drafts, continuations, divisionals, and jurisdiction-specific filings
MUST be derived.

This document is NOT a filing document.

It defines claim intent, scope boundaries, and engineering anchoring
points to ensure that all intellectual property claims remain
implementable, defensible, and system-consistent.

---

## 2. Claim Architecture Principles

The Prospera OS Patent Family is constructed under the following
non-negotiable principles:

1. Claims MUST map to concrete system responsibilities.
2. Claims MUST be enforceable through system behavior.
3. Claims MUST prohibit actions, not merely describe capabilities.
4. Claims MUST align with governance-first execution control.
5. Claims MUST support continuation and jurisdictional partitioning.

---

## 3. Root Claim (Anchor Claim)

### Root Claim A — Governance-First Execution Operating System

A system for governing execution and generation involving artificial
intelligence, comprising:

- an input boundary governance layer configured to preserve original
  input semantics and prohibit implicit transformation prior to system
  admission;

- a stage-based governance pipeline comprising a plurality of ordered
  governance stages enforcing authority constraints prior to execution;

- a deterministic arbitration mechanism configured to produce
  pre-execution decisions based on system coordinates;

- an enforcement layer configured to bind arbitration outcomes to
  execution or generation actions and to deny or suspend such actions
  when governance conditions are unmet;

- a human-in-the-loop authority mechanism configured to require explicit
  human resolution for non-delegable decisions;

- a verification mechanism configured to reproduce identical arbitration
  and enforcement outcomes for identical inputs;

wherein execution or generation is prohibited unless all governance
conditions are satisfied.

---

## 4. Primary Claim Branches

### Branch B — Input Boundary Semantic Preservation

Claims covering:

- detection of language, script, locale, and modality at input admission;
- prohibition of implicit translation, normalization, or reinterpretation;
- binding of immutable semantic contracts prior to execution.

Engineering Anchor:
Input Boundary Governance Layer, Semantic Contract Specifications.

---

### Branch C — Stage-Based Governance Pipeline

Claims covering:

- enforcement of a fixed, non-bypassable sequence of governance stages;
- prevention of execution outside the defined stage order;
- separation of authority, validation, execution, and output.

Engineering Anchor:
Stage 01–05 Governance Pipeline.

---

### Branch D — Deterministic Arbitration Coordinates

Claims covering:

- coordinate-based arbitration for pre-execution decisions;
- deterministic outcomes for identical invocation contexts;
- prohibition of heuristic or probabilistic overrides.

Engineering Anchor:
SYSTEM_COORDINATES Arbitration Model.

---

### Branch E — Enforcement Adapter Binding

Claims covering:

- binding of arbitration outcomes to ALLOW, DENY, or ESCALATE actions;
- failure-closed execution behavior;
- prohibition of silent fallback or retry.

Engineering Anchor:
Enforcement Adapter Specifications.

---

### Branch F — Human-in-the-Loop Authority

Claims covering:

- explicit reservation of non-delegable decisions for human actors;
- prohibition of AI inference, proxy, or simulation of human judgment;
- logging of human resolutions as immutable system inputs.

Engineering Anchor:
HUMAN_IN_THE_LOOP_AUTHORITY_SPEC.

---

### Branch G — Verification, CI, and Replay Invariants

Claims covering:

- deterministic replay of governance decisions;
- blocking of system admission on verification failure;
- use of replay artifacts as audit and compliance evidence.

Engineering Anchor:
CI / Replay Verification Gate.

---

## 5. Extension and Continuation Strategy

Each primary branch may be independently extended through continuation
or divisional filings, including but not limited to:

- replay as legal evidence mechanisms;
- multilingual and multimodal semantic drift detection;
- risk envelope enforcement via arbitration coordinates;
- escalation resolution logging and audit binding.

---

## 6. Jurisdictional Alignment Notes

This claim architecture is designed to support filing in:

- United States (execution control and enforcement emphasis)
- European Union (technical effect and failure prevention emphasis)
- China (system architecture and control flow emphasis)
- Taiwan (engineering process and module interaction emphasis)

Jurisdiction-specific claim wording MUST preserve the intent and
boundaries defined herein.

---

## 7. Authority Statement

This document is authoritative for all engineering-to-patent mappings.

Any patent claim not traceable to this Claim Tree is non-canonical and
requires explicit architectural review.
