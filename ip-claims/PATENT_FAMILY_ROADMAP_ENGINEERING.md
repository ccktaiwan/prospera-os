# Prospera OS — Patent Family Roadmap (Engineering Controlled)

Status: Canonical (IP Engineering Control Document)
Version: v1.0
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Scope: Global Patent Family Planning and Control
Authority: SYSTEM_INDEX (SSOT)

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the canonical, engineering-controlled roadmap for
the Prospera OS patent family.

It establishes claim scope, sequencing, jurisdictional allocation, and
defensive coverage strategy based on system architecture rather than
business timing.

This roadmap governs how Prospera OS intellectual property is partitioned,
sequenced, and expanded without fragmenting system authority.

## 2. Roadmap Governance Principles

The following principles are mandatory:

- System-layer claims precede module-layer claims
- Governance and arbitration are claimed before optimization
- No patent family member may redefine system authority
- All claims must map to canonical claim axes
- Jurisdictional variation does not alter engineering substance

## 3. Canonical Claim Axes Reference

All patent family members MUST map to one or more of the following axes:

- A1: Pre-Execution Arbitration
- A2: Execution / Generation Separation
- A3: System Coordinates (Vertical / Horizontal)
- A4: Governance Load Shedding and Capability Degradation
- A5: Enforcement Adapter
- A6: Deterministic Replay and Audit

Absence of axis mapping implies non-canonical scope.

## 4. Patent Family Structure (Engineering View)

### 4.1 Core System Patent (Mother Application)

Designation:
Governance-First Execution Operating System

Primary Axes:
A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6

Engineering Scope:
- Five-stage system architecture
- Non-bypassable governance kernel
- Execution and generation arbitration
- Dynamic capability degradation
- Deterministic replay

Jurisdictions:
US, EP, CN, TW

Role:
Defines the non-replaceable system boundary for Prospera OS.

### 4.2 Sub-Family I — Execution / Generation Arbitration

Designation:
Pre-Execution Arbitration for AI-Assisted Systems

Primary Axes:
A1, A2, A3, A5

Engineering Scope:
- Permission evaluation prior to execution
- Coordinate-bounded capability requests
- Enforcement binding

Defensive Target:
Autonomous agent systems and workflow engines

Role:
Prevents circumvention via agent autonomy or orchestration abstraction.

### 4.3 Sub-Family II — Governance Load Shedding

Designation:
Dynamic Risk Absorption and Capability Degradation

Primary Axes:
A4, A3

Engineering Scope:
- Accumulated risk state modeling
- Monotonic reduction of permitted capability
- Governance-triggered recovery paths

Defensive Target:
Long-running automation and enterprise embedded AI

Role:
Covers structural risk control independent of arbitration mechanics.

### 4.4 Sub-Family III — Deterministic Replay and Audit

Designation:
Replayable Governance Verification Systems

Primary Axes:
A6, A1

Engineering Scope:
- Replay without state mutation
- Governance consistency verification
- Audit trace integrity

Defensive Target:
Regulated industries and compliance-driven deployments

Role:
Locks compliance and verification claims to Prospera OS architecture.

### 4.5 Sub-Family IV — Enforcement Adapter Isolation

Designation:
Non-Bypassable Execution Enforcement Interfaces

Primary Axes:
A5, A1

Engineering Scope:
- Fail-closed execution gating
- Isolation of decision authority from execution
- Interface-bound enforcement

Defensive Target:
SDKs, integrations, and third-party extensions

Role:
Prevents reimplementation of Prospera logic through client-side bypass.

## 5. Sequencing and Filing Logic

The filing order is engineering-driven:

1. Core System Patent
2. Arbitration Sub-Family
3. Load Shedding Sub-Family
4. Replay Sub-Family
5. Enforcement Adapter Sub-Family

Later filings MUST reference the core system without redefining it.

## 6. Jurisdictional Allocation Strategy

- US: Broad system claims and technical improvement framing
- EP: Technical effect and determinism emphasis
- CN: Modular process and control flow emphasis
- TW: Engineering process and system architecture emphasis

Jurisdictional tailoring does not alter claim substance.

## 7. Defensive Coverage Guarantee

This roadmap ensures:

- No single rejection collapses overall protection
- Partial grant preserves system-level exclusion
- Competitors cannot implement enterprise-grade systems without
  intersecting at least one claim family

## 8. Canonical Control Rule

Any new patent proposal MUST:

- Declare target sub-family
- Declare mapped claim axes
- Demonstrate non-overlap conflict resolution
- Be approved at the architecture governance level

Unauthorized patent drafting is prohibited.
