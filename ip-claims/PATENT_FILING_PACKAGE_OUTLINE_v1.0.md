Patent Filing Package Outline v1.0

Status: Stable
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: Intellectual Property
Authority: Patent Filing Reference

This document defines the complete package required to file patent
applications covering the Prospera OS governance-first execution system.

It is intended for direct handoff to patent counsel and ensures
consistent translation from system architecture to legal claims.


1. Filing Objective

The objective of this filing package is to secure patent protection
for a governance-first execution operating system that determines
execution permission prior to action, governs AI participation as
engineering labor, and defines canonical system existence.

This filing prioritizes system architecture and governance mechanisms
over specific implementations or applications.


2. Core Claim Set (Required)

The following documents define the core patent claims and must be
included in all initial filings.

2.1 Patent Claim Mapping v1.0

File:
ip-claims/PATENT_CLAIM_MAPPING_v1.0.md

Purpose:
Defines the structured mapping from externally verified system
architecture to patent-eligible claim groups.


2.2 Claim Strength & Prior Art Risk Matrix v1.0

File:
ip-claims/CLAIM_STRENGTH_AND_PRIOR_ART_RISK_MATRIX_v1.0.md

Purpose:
Evaluates claim novelty, prior art exposure, enforceability,
and strategic value to guide claim prioritization.


3. System Existence and Authority Evidence (Required)

The following artifacts establish system existence and authority
independent of implementation.

3.1 Canonical System Index

File:
SYSTEM_INDEX.md

Purpose:
Defines authoritative existence and non-existence of system components.


3.2 External Review Pack v1.0

Files:
system/external-review/EXTERNAL_ARCHITECT_REVIEW_CHECKLIST_v1.0.md
system/external-review/EXTERNAL_REVIEW_RESULT_TEMPLATE_v1.0.md
system/external-review/MOCK_EXTERNAL_REVIEW_RESULT_v1.0.md
system/external-review/EXTERNAL_REVIEW_ENTRY_GUIDE_v1.0.md

Purpose:
Provides third-party-verifiable evidence of system architecture,
governance-first execution, and auditability.


4. Governance and Enforcement References (Supporting)

The following documents support claim interpretation and enforcement
but are not direct claim definitions.

4.1 Governance Semantic Baseline v0.2

File:
governance/SEMANTIC_BASELINE_v0.2.md

Purpose:
Defines governance interpretation boundaries and enforcement semantics.


4.2 Governance Index v0.2

File:
governance/governance-formalization/governance-index-v0.2.md

Purpose:
Defines governance document hierarchy and authority precedence.


5. Recommended Filing Strategy

5.1 Initial Filing

- File Claim Groups A and B as independent claims
- Include Claim Groups C, D, and E as dependent claims
- Maintain implementation-agnostic language

5.2 Jurisdiction Strategy

- Prioritize jurisdictions recognizing software and system claims
- Adjust AI-related claim language to local standards

5.3 Continuation Strategy

- Reserve AI-as-Engineering-Worker claims for continuation filings
- Extend canonical index claims into compliance and safety domains


6. Excluded Scope (Explicit)

This filing package explicitly excludes:

- Mobile operating systems
- Application-layer workflows
- Industry-specific consulting methods
- Branding or marketing systems
- Feature-level implementations


7. Counsel Action Items

Patent counsel should:

- Translate claim mappings into jurisdiction-specific legal language
- Validate prior art positioning
- Prepare diagrams illustrating governance-first execution flow
- Maintain alignment with frozen External Review Pack v1.0


8. Versioning and Change Control

This filing package is based on frozen artifacts defined in
External Review Pack v1.0.

Any future claim expansion must reference a new system baseline
and must not retroactively modify this filing package.
