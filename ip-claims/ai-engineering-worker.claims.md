Title: AI-as-Engineering-Worker — Claim Language
Status: Draft (Claim-Ready)
Version: v1.0
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Scope: Patent Claims
System Alignment: Prospera OS Canonical Architecture

Claim 1 (Independent)

A governance-first execution system, comprising:

a governance layer defining non-overridable authority rules governing whether actions may be permitted, blocked, or escalated;

a kernel layer enforcing execution gating logic that cannot be bypassed or modified by downstream components;

a system layer configured to validate, audit, and mediate execution outcomes;

and at least one artificial intelligence component,

wherein the artificial intelligence component is constrained to operate as an engineering worker, and

wherein the artificial intelligence component:

generates execution artifacts only when explicitly invoked by an authorized system process;

lacks authority to originate, modify, or override governance rules;

lacks capability to bypass kernel enforcement;

does not make final execution decisions; and

produces outputs treated as engineering work products subject to validation, acceptance, rejection, or escalation by the system layer.

Claim 2 (Dependent)

The system of claim 1, wherein all authoritative decisions remain exclusively within the governance layer or pre-defined system governance mechanisms independent of the artificial intelligence component.

Claim 3 (Dependent)

The system of claim 1, wherein the artificial intelligence component is prohibited from self-activating or independently initiating execution paths.

Claim 4 (Dependent)

The system of claim 1, wherein the artificial intelligence component is prevented from modifying execution behavior unless such modification is explicitly permitted and validated by kernel enforcement logic.

Claim 5 (Dependent)

The system of claim 1, wherein outputs generated by the artificial intelligence component are classified as non-authoritative artifacts requiring system-layer mediation prior to execution.

Claim 6 (Dependent)

The system of claim 1, wherein the system explicitly excludes autonomous artificial intelligence agents capable of independent decision-making or authority delegation.

Claim 7 (Dependent)

The system of claim 1, wherein the artificial intelligence component operates analogously to a human engineering worker under enforced supervision, validation, and escalation constraints.

Claim 8 (Method Claim)

A method of governed execution, comprising:

invoking an artificial intelligence component solely through authorized system processes;

constraining the artificial intelligence component to generate execution artifacts without governance authority;

validating said artifacts through a system layer operating under kernel enforcement; and

permitting execution only upon satisfaction of governance-defined conditions.

Claim 9 (Dependent)

The method of claim 8, wherein failure to satisfy governance-defined conditions results in blocking or escalation without artificial intelligence intervention.

Claim 10 (Dependent)

The system of claim 1, wherein any attempt by the artificial intelligence component to exceed its engineering worker role is rejected by kernel enforcement prior to execution.
