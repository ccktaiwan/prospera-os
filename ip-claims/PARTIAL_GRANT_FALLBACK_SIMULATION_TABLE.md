# Prospera OS — Partial Grant / Fallback Simulation Table

Status: Canonical (IP Defense Simulation)
Version: v1.0
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Scope: Partial Grant and Claim Reduction Defense
Authority: SYSTEM_INDEX (SSOT)

## 1. Purpose

This document simulates partial grant and claim reduction scenarios to
demonstrate that Prospera OS retains enforceable protection under adverse
examination outcomes.

## 2. Simulation Principles

- System remains valid under claim loss.
- Fallback claims map to existing system stages.
- No fallback introduces new system behavior.

## 3. Partial Grant Scenarios

### Scenario A — Loss of Load Shedding Claims (A4)

Remaining Axes:
A1, A2, A3, A5, A6

System Coverage:
- Pre-execution arbitration remains.
- Enforcement and replay remain.

Defensive Outcome:
Competitors still must implement arbitration and enforcement.

---

### Scenario B — Loss of Replay Claims (A6)

Remaining Axes:
A1, A2, A3, A4, A5

System Coverage:
- Execution control remains.
- Risk absorption remains.

Defensive Outcome:
Enterprise-grade systems still intersect control and degradation.

---

### Scenario C — Loss of Coordinate Claims (A3)

Remaining Axes:
A1, A2, A4, A5, A6

System Coverage:
- Permission and enforcement remain.
- Risk degradation remains.

Defensive Outcome:
Design-around still sacrifices determinism or safety.

---

### Scenario D — Only Arbitration + Enforcement Granted

Remaining Axes:
A1, A5

System Coverage:
- Permission gating and execution binding.

Defensive Outcome:
Still blocks autonomous agents and unsafe workflows.

## 4. Examiner-Facing Conclusion

No partial grant collapses Prospera OS protection.

Each fallback scenario preserves at least one unavoidable system control
mechanism required for enterprise deployment.
