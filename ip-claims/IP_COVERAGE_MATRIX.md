# Prospera OS — IP Coverage Matrix

Status: Canonical (IP-Oriented Engineering Specification)
Version: v1.0
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Scope: Coverage Validation Across Stages, Coordinates, and Claim Axes
Authority: SYSTEM_INDEX (SSOT)

## Purpose

This document defines the IP Coverage Matrix for Prospera OS.

It demonstrates how the Execution / Generation Arbitration Pattern and
its associated claim axes cover all system stages and coordinate
combinations in a deterministic, non-bypassable manner.

The matrix establishes completeness, non-substitutability, and
system-level differentiation for intellectual property purposes.

In case of conflict, governance specifications take precedence.

## Matrix Dimensions

The coverage matrix is defined across three orthogonal dimensions:

- System Stage: Stage 01–Stage 05
- System Coordinates:
  - Vertical (V0–V4): consequence irreversibility
  - Horizontal (H0–H4): generation depth
- Claim Axis:
  - Method
  - System
  - Non-Transitory Computer-Readable Medium

## Coverage Principles

- Every system stage MUST be covered by all claim axes.
- Every valid coordinate combination MUST be arbitrated.
- No execution or generation path exists outside the matrix.
- Coverage does not imply permission; it implies governance applicability.

## Coverage Matrix Summary

### Stage 01 — System Boundary

- Coordinates: V0 / H0
- Coverage:
  - Method: Boundary evaluation and arbitration initiation
  - System: Boundary enforcement module
  - Medium: Stored instructions enforcing pre-entry checks

### Stage 02 — Governance Formalization

- Coordinates: V0–V1 / H0–H3
- Coverage:
  - Method: Exploratory arbitration with bounded generation
  - System: Governance intent translation components
  - Medium: Instructions limiting generation depth

### Stage 03 — Invocation Validation

- Coordinates: V1–V2 / H0–H2
- Coverage:
  - Method: Validation-stage arbitration
  - System: Coordinate validation and decision generator
  - Medium: Replayable validation instructions

### Stage 04 — Execution Binding

- Coordinates: V2–V3 / H0–H1
- Coverage:
  - Method: Pre-execution arbitration and enforcement
  - System: Enforcement adapter gating execution
  - Medium: Deterministic execution binding instructions

### Stage 05 — Generation Surface

- Coordinates: V4 / H0
- Coverage:
  - Method: Autonomous execution arbitration
  - System: Final execution gate without generation
  - Medium: Stored instructions prohibiting generation

## Cross-Axis Completeness

For every stage:

- Method claims cover procedural arbitration.
- System claims cover structural enforcement.
- Medium claims cover executable instruction embodiment.

No single axis alone is sufficient; all three are required to fully
realize the Prospera OS arbitration mechanism.

## Non-Substitutability Argument

A system lacking any of the following cannot achieve equivalent coverage:

- Stage-aware arbitration
- Coordinate-bounded generation
- Deterministic enforcement prior to execution
- Replayable governance decisions

Agent-based or tool-centric systems fail to cover at least one axis
or stage-coordinate combination.

## Canonical Statement

This matrix demonstrates that Prospera OS implements a closed,
governance-first arbitration space.

All execution and generation actions are subject to this matrix.
No external system can replicate this behavior without infringing
upon one or more claim axes.
