# Prospera OS — Claim Strength & Prior Art Risk Matrix v1.0

Status: Draft  
Version: v1.0  
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group  
Purpose: Claim Prioritization and Patent Filing Risk Assessment  

---

## 1. Document Objective

This document evaluates each identified claim domain
based on:

- Technical strength
- System enforceability
- Prior art exposure
- Patent filing suitability

It supports strategic decisions on:
- Which claims to file
- Which to defer
- Which to abandon

---

## 2. Evaluation Dimensions

Each claim domain is assessed across four dimensions.

### 2.1 Claim Strength

- High: Core system behavior, difficult to replicate
- Medium: Requires careful framing
- Low: Conceptual or easily bypassed

### 2.2 Prior Art Risk

- Low: No clear analogs in existing systems
- Medium: Partial overlap with known systems
- High: Strong similarity to existing art

### 2.3 Enforceability

- High: Non-bypassable system enforcement
- Medium: Enforced by convention or workflow
- Low: Documentation or policy only

### 2.4 Strategic Value

- Core: Defines Prospera OS identity
- Support: Strengthens primary claims
- Optional: Defensive or future use

## 3. Claim Evaluation Matrix

### Claim Domain 1 — Governance-First Execution Control

| Dimension | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Claim Strength | High |
| Prior Art Risk | Low |
| Enforceability | High |
| Strategic Value | Core |

Notes:
Strong candidate for primary independent claim.

---

### Claim Domain 2 — Non-Bypassable Semantic Baseline

| Dimension | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Claim Strength | High |
| Prior Art Risk | Low–Medium |
| Enforceability | High |
| Strategic Value | Core |

Notes:
Novel framing required to avoid documentation-based interpretations.

---

### Claim Domain 3 — AI-as-Engineering-Worker Control Model

| Dimension | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Claim Strength | Medium–High |
| Prior Art Risk | Medium |
| Enforceability | Medium–High |
| Strategic Value | Core / Support |

Notes:
Avoid “assistant” or “agent” language.

---

### Claim Domain 4 — Bidirectional Generation & Validation Loop

| Dimension | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Claim Strength | Medium |
| Prior Art Risk | Medium |
| Enforceability | Medium |
| Strategic Value | Support |

Notes:
Use as dependent claim only.

---

### Claim Domain 5 — Cross-Phase Governance Enforcement

| Dimension | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Claim Strength | Medium |
| Prior Art Risk | Medium–High |
| Enforceability | Medium |
| Strategic Value | Support / Optional |

Notes:
Risk of overlap with SDLC tooling—requires careful scoping.

---

## 4. Filing Priority Recommendation

| Priority | Claim Domains |
|--------|----------------|
| Primary Filing | Domain 1, Domain 2 |
| Secondary Filing | Domain 3 |
| Dependent Claims | Domain 4 |
| Defer / Defensive | Domain 5 |

---

## 5. Counsel Instruction

Patent counsel should:

- Draft 1–2 independent claims from Primary Filing domains
- Use Secondary Filing domains as dependent claims
- Avoid filing Optional domains unless jurisdiction requires
