# Prospera OS — Patent Filing Package Outline v1.0

Status: Draft  
Version: v1.0  
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group  
Purpose: Patent Filing Preparation and Counsel Handoff  

---

## 1. Package Objective

This document defines the scope, structure, and contents
of the Prospera OS patent filing package.

It provides patent counsel with a clear system-level view
of what is claimable, how claims are grounded, and
which materials constitute authoritative technical evidence.

This package is designed to support:
- Independent claim drafting
- Dependent claim expansion
- Prior art risk mitigation

---

## 2. Filing Scope Definition

The patent filing scope covers:

- Governance-first execution operating system architecture
- Non-bypassable enforcement mechanisms
- AI-as-engineering-worker control model
- Cross-phase execution governance

This filing explicitly excludes:
- Specific AI model implementations
- Application-level use cases
- UI, branding, or product packaging

---

## 3. Primary Claim Domains

Primary claim domains are defined as follows:

1. Governance-first execution control system  
2. Non-overridable semantic baseline enforcement  
3. AI execution constrained by authority and traversal rules  

These domains are intended to form the basis
of one or more independent claims.

---

## 4. Supporting Claim Domains

Supporting domains are intended for dependent claims:

- Bidirectional generation and validation loop
- Cross-phase governance enforcement mechanisms
- System-wide execution gating and escalation

These domains reinforce enforceability
but are not required for core novelty.

---

## 5. Canonical Technical References

All claims must trace to canonical system artifacts.

Authoritative sources include:

- SYSTEM_INDEX.md  
- governance/SEMANTIC_BASELINE_v0.2.md  
- Claim-to-System Mapping v1.0  
- Claim Strength & Prior Art Risk Matrix v1.0  
- Phase C Semantic Baseline (tagged release)

Non-canonical or reference-only documents
must not be used as claim anchors.

---

## 6. Diagram and Figure Set (Planned)

The following diagrams will accompany the filing:

- System layer architecture overview
- Governance kernel enforcement flow
- Execution gating and escalation sequence
- AI worker traversal and constraint flow

Diagrams are conceptual system figures,
not implementation schematics.

---

## 7. Counsel Working Instructions

Patent counsel is requested to:

1. Draft claims at the system and control level
2. Avoid model-specific or implementation-specific language
3. Preserve non-bypassable enforcement framing
4. Coordinate continuation strategy for secondary domains

---

## 8. Jurisdiction and Continuation Strategy (Open)

Jurisdiction selection and continuation strategy
will be determined with patent counsel.

This outline supports:
- Initial filing
- Continuation-in-part planning
- Defensive publication if required
