# Prospera OS — Patent Counsel Brief v1.0

Status: Final  
Version: v1.0  
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group  
Audience: Lead Patent Counsel  
Purpose: Patent Strategy Alignment and Claim Framing  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Prospera OS is a governance-first execution operating system.

It is designed to determine whether actions — including
AI-assisted generation and human execution — may be
permitted, blocked, or escalated under non-bypassable
governance rules.

This is not an application, model, or workflow tool.
It is a system-level control architecture.

The core invention lies in how execution authority,
semantic constraints, and AI participation are enforced
prior to execution, not after.

---

## 2. Nature of the Invention

The invention should be understood as:

- A system architecture
- With non-overridable enforcement
- Governing execution eligibility
- Across engineering phases

Prospera OS introduces governance as a first-class,
pre-execution control mechanism.

AI is treated as a constrained engineering worker,
not an autonomous agent.

---

## 3. Claim Framing Guidance

Primary claim framing should focus on:

- Governance-first execution control
- Non-bypassable enforcement mechanisms
- Authority and semantic gating prior to execution

Claims should explicitly avoid:

- AI model internals
- Training methods
- Application-level use cases
- UI or product-specific features

The claims are system-level and control-oriented.

---

## 4. Claim Scope Summary

Based on internal evaluation, the following claim domains
are prioritized:

Primary (Independent Claims):
- Governance-first execution control system
- Non-overridable semantic baseline enforcement

Secondary (Dependent Claims):
- AI-as-engineering-worker control model
- Bidirectional generation and validation loop

Optional / Deferred:
- Cross-phase governance enforcement mechanisms

Detailed mappings and risk assessments are provided
in accompanying documents.

---

## 5. Canonical Technical Evidence

All claims must trace to canonical system artifacts.

Authoritative references include:

- SYSTEM_INDEX.md
- Claim-to-System Mapping v1.0
- Claim Strength & Prior Art Risk Matrix v1.0
- Patent Filing Package Outline v1.0
- Diagram Set Outline v1.0
- Phase C Semantic Baseline (tagged release)

Non-canonical or exploratory materials
should not be used as claim anchors.

---

## 6. Drafting and Collaboration Expectations

Patent counsel is requested to:

- Preserve abstraction at the system level
- Avoid narrowing claims via implementation detail
- Coordinate continuation strategies early
- Treat this as a platform patent, not a feature patent

Engineering artifacts are available upon request,
but are not required for initial claim drafting.

---

## 7. Filing Strategy (Open)

Jurisdiction selection, continuation strategy,
and defensive publication decisions will be
finalized jointly with patent counsel.

This brief is intended to accelerate
productive collaboration, not constrain it.
