# Prospera OS — U.S. Patent Specification Narrative

Status: Canonical (Legal Narrative — US)
Version: v1.0
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Authority: SYSTEM_INDEX (SSOT)

## Field of the Invention
Computer systems for governance-first control of execution and generation
in AI-assisted enterprise environments.

## Technical Problem
Conventional AI systems authorize actions based on capability, leading to
irreversible errors, non-deterministic outcomes, and lack of verifiable control.

## Technical Solution
A governance-first execution operating system implementing:
(1) pre-action execution/generation arbitration using stage-aware coordinates,
and (2) deterministic governance load shedding that proactively degrades
capability under accumulated risk.

## System Architecture
Five-stage execution architecture with a non-bypassable governance kernel,
explicit separation of authority and capability, bounded enforcement adapters,
and deterministic replay.

## Arbitration Mechanism
Mandatory arbitration prior to any state change, producing deterministic
PASS/BLOCK/ESCALATE outcomes bound to enforcement.

## Load Shedding Mechanism
Continuous risk accumulation and monotonic capability degradation that
constrains future permission space before failure.

## Technical Effects
- Improved computer system reliability
- Deterministic control of AI-assisted execution
- Prevention of irreversible execution errors
- Verifiable and replayable governance decisions

## Distinction Over Prior Art
Permission evaluated before capability invocation; AI stripped of authority;
risk absorbed structurally, not post hoc.
