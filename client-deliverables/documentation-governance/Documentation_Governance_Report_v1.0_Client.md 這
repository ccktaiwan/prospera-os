Purpose

This document defines an executable, governed, and auditable pipeline for
generating client-facing Documentation Governance Reports from machine-generated
documentation inventory artifacts.

The specification conforms to international engineering documentation standards
by providing explicit interfaces, execution matrices, control points, and
enforcement rules.

Scope

This pipeline governs:

Deterministic transformation of documentation inventory data

Automated execution within CI environments

Controlled exposure of governance results to clients

This pipeline explicitly excludes:

Documentation remediation

Content modification

Manual interpretation of inventory data
